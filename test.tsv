37451	"we switched on the advice of the then new adhd therapist. it took longer to &quot;kick in&quot; and build up than other meds we tried but it has been a god send. his grades are way up and he's not as hot or cold as he used to be. my only issues are he won't eat while on it...not even a tiny bite. dr is keeping an eye on the weight. also, to me, he's not himself. i don't like the flatness because his personality is so big! at least it wears off!"	-10
193385	"helps me sleep, but i don't notice much relaxing of the jaw muscles. i only take 10mg as i don't like pills, so maybe that is why (says i can take up to 20mg). i haven't felt some of what others have said in previous reviews."	-10
216485	"sometimes use it. really good effect, my wife happy! erection is very strong and long, and absolutely no side effects for me."	-10
84065	i first started this birth control two years ago when i became sexually active. children are not in my near future. trinessa has been nothing but good for me! no bad side effects at all. i am a healthy 19 year old female and would recommend this drug to any woman who is looking to protect themselves.	-10
146801	i was prescribed these for an onset of panic attacks that would spike my bp to 175 over 130. taking these 0.5 mg pills did nothing but make me lose my short term memory. i still felt panicked and my bp would only drop slightly until i rode out the attack.	-10
125177	"i decided to take dulcolax last night because i have been constipated for about a week and a half. i thought my constpation was going to better in time; however, it did not. when i did go, my stool looked like small angular black pebbles. i took this medication around 7:30 pm. then the pain started at 3:12 am in the morning. i have never felt such a pain in my life. i feel like i'm being stabbed in the stomach. i can hear the gas in my bowels shredding through my stomach. i am sweating and nauseous. i don't even know what to do. i thought sitting on the toilet would help. it is now 3:58 am in my dulcolax journey. i wish i took something else, correction anything else before i tried dulcolax. the pain just keeps getting worse! avoid!"	-10
213875	"omg this stuff burns 100x worse than the yi!! i inserted it about 15 mins ago and laid right down. i was so uncomfortable i would rather not of taken anything and just called my doc for a prescription. i do not recommend! after the burning started, i wondered if this was normal so i started looking for reviews. after reading through them i decided i couldn't take the burning/itching anymore. i went to the toilet and pushed the gel out and wiped all the cream off. for awhile i just wanted to scratch with something sharp cause it was a painful itch. now i'm laying in bed with a cool wash cloth between my legs feeling a little bit better. man, that was torture!!!"	-10
84859	"i only took this medication for the first month, but i refuse to continue with it. the first week everything was fine, but over the course of two weeks i've had extreme mood swings that just kept progressing to the point that i couldn't stand to be near my two year old. every little thing she did set me off and that terrifies me because i've always had so much patience with her. i was having horrible vivid dreams and the last day i was on it i had been having suicidal ideations. i'd rather just risk getting pregnant than to risk feeling like that ever again."	-10
29397	it has been 1 year and i'm still suffering from the side effects of this awful medicine. i was put on this because of severe migraines that was shutting down the left side of my body top to bottom. i was only taking 1/2 a pill for 2 weeks which in turn gave me kidney stones. the stones in turn tore my ureter so now i have had 1 blockage from scar tissue and the scar tissue is growing back again. my ureter has narrowed and now going through all the blood work to see how much my kidney is damaged and different procedures for my tube. i take no meds for migraines now i have been seeing an acupuncturist. as far as migraines i have none as long as i have acupuncture.	-10
207232	"i would never take the time to do this if this pill didn't truly change my life. i have gotten cold sores for years now, just about every month. i finally asked my dentist if he could prescribe something for me because my wedding is coming up and i did not want to have one on my big day. i have used the medicine twice now.. the first time a blister never even formed i just had the hard bump on my lip and it was gone by the second day. i felt my lip getting hard again sunday so i immediately took 2 pills and then 2 more 12 hours later. monday morning i woke up and a small blister had formed(didn't hurt or look bad but i was still worried.) it is now tuesday morning and my lip is completely healed! this pill works miracles!"	-10
109857	"i got on the nexplanon the same day i had my baby, feb 9 2016, i have gained over 24 pounds, i just recently began having headaches almost everyday, my ankles swell up a lot, and i'm extra moody. the great thing about this birth control is you don't get pregnant and its nothing you have to worry about. i got the nexplanon right after i had my first baby and my side affects were extremely different. i got depressed, i lost a lot of weight(which i loved), i had a lot of energy, but i had random 3 week long periods. i don't really recommend any woman to get this but then again every woman is different."	-10
125159	took one tablet - like any sensible person trying something new - at night time and woke up needing the toilet. went. all good. do not understand the hysterical reviews on here..	-10
7427	"i just used this cream almost 3 hours ago, and i think my vagina is about to fall off! it is worse than before! the intense burning sensation and discomfort. i was doing well with the vinegar, so i don't know why i bought this mess. never again!"	-10
143447	i just want to tell everyone with the implant that if your bleeding for more than a week take ibuprofen 3 times a day for 3 days. if it doesn't stop the bleeding then go to the doctor!! your periods are only suppose to last 1 week if more it needs removed!	-10
183019	was taking this along with 450mg of lyrica a day and 150mg of tramadol a day. nothing helped with pain but i went into such a depression that i could no longer even go out into public. i slowly weened myself off of all of it. i have pain but at least i can go out into the public.	-10
209146	helped sleep but caused restless legs syndrome.	-10
47464	"do not go from kapanol to tapenadol, i ended up in hospital with severe tremors through my body. i thought i was having a heart attack. tapentadol won't hold you if you make the switch and you end up feeling severely ill."	-10
29160	"miracle drug! the side effects can be daunting at first, like tingling/numbness in extremities that won't stop for hours, but if you increase your water intake substantially and power through, it's totally worth it. my daily tension headaches are 90% gone, which is huge for me. it didn't do much in terms of overall muscle pain reduction or the daily body aches, but i did lose over 30 pounds in four months. i stopped drinking all carbonated drinks (because it makes them all taste super flat weirdly) and definitely am not as hungry as i used to be, so that's just a bonus."	-10
12708	i have been on enbrel for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis for over 8 yrs. in the beginning my psoriasis was the worst but after having to be off enbrel for 7-8 months in order to take immunizations my psoriatic arthritis had gotten the best of me. i have been back on enbrel now for 5 weeks of one injection of 50mg. i totally feel everything is going back to where i was. the psoriasis is almost gone (which is great considering i was 90% covered within two months of stopping) but the arthritis is taking just a little longer. this medicine saved my life years ago. i am almost 48 and have suffered with this since i was 13.	-10
153481	i am 43 and have been taking monodox for a few weeks. it is working great with no side effects. solodyn also worked great for me but had so many side effects that i had to stop taking it. i am also using a topical with retinal. in my 20's i took accutane which worked for about 10 years. started getting cystic acne again in my late 30's. i am very pleased with this medicine.	-10
10351	"i have tried most all maintance inhalers due to the fact i was using my rescue inhaler way to much throughout the day. after many failed attempts at all the others i was given a sample of breo, not expecting much of a differance, boy was i wrong. i could tell on the 2nd day it was working! i breath soooo much better and can go without my resue ventalin ..huge differance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	-10
199767	"i am so grateful for this medication. i smoked a pack a day for over 20 years. the longest i went without a cigarette was 3 weeks. i tried the patch, the gum, and the electronic cigarette; nothing worked (though the patch was great for long flights). my experience is a little different than most because i never had bad dreams (they've actually be better) since i started, i'm never nauseated (though i make sure i take the morning pill after breakfast and the evening pill after dinner), and i didn't stop smoking until month two (not week two). on week two, the number of cigarettes i was smoking dropped down to about five per day. and i didn't even notice i was cutting down. i highly recommend this to quit."	-10
89658	"since i graduated high school, i have been on a number of antidepressants. so far celexa is the only one that relieved my anxiety and left my sex drive alone. i've been getting better sleep at night, but i feel a little tired during the day at times. but that definitely beats staying up all night with racing thoughts. i like it so far."	-10
47790	"i've been battling acne ever since i was a teenager, and now i'm 23, still battling acne until here recently. i had heard about differin, and how adapalene can help stubborn acne. i purchased the gel about 2 weeks ago, and i must say my breakouts are almost gone. i dealt with dryness and a burning sensation the first few days, but my skin got used to it after that. what helps is washing your face, applying moisturizer, and then applying the differin. this makes it less harsh for the skin. i can't wait to see how my skin will look in 2 months. don't give up on this stuff, it's a work in progress."	-10
129353	"i have had the mirena in almost 2 years. it has cause so much pain. whenever i first got it the obgyn told me i would not have periods and if i did it just be here and there of spotting. the bleeding that's recently been happening is really heavy bleeding. i don't know if something is wrong or what's going on with it. i wouldn't suggest it to anybody. it causes so much pain and periods are not regular, and they are very heavy periods. it was so much money to get it in, but there is no way i'm keeping it, the mood swings, the random heavy periods, and the pain. i can't handle it any more."	-10
72647	"this is literally a nightmare for your skin. on the week where you aren't taking the pill, my skin literally dried up. and almost immediately on the first day of taking the the pill after the break week, i will wake up the next morning with a cyst or two on my chin. i am done using this for good. destroys your skin."	-10
33589	"this pill is not the best for me. before going on it about 5 months ago, i had worked very hard to lose 20lbs, just to gain 15 of it back in about 2.5 to 3 months, with no real change in diet. i was even working out every day! the weight just will not go away. my mood has been unstable, not out of control, but very hit and miss. i have developed dark spots on my face which are very embarrassing, as well as acne. my hair is brittle and breaks and so do my nails. the only &quot;perk&quot; is that my boobs have gotten bigger, but they were pretty large to begin with, so that is really only good for my boyfriend. i have an appointment to change my pill today!"	-10
115758	"i used to have a wonderful smart son. about 12 years ago, i noticed changes starting to take affect in his life. he was becoming agitated, he was loosing his memory, he had no energy. i was told this was due to his having so many seizures. i just this week, after having a really bad week a few weeks ago, the doctor decided to take him off of this medication in a hospital controlled setting. after one day of not taking this medication, i am starting to see the personality of my son come back. he had gotten to the point that he made terrible decisions, he was depressed often, he was confused and was loosing his memory and his ability to talk and remember words. i'm sorry, but the benefits of controlling seizures was not worth this."	-10
112650	"i tried lunesta for severe insomnia and it didn't work for me. it gave me a very bitter, nasty, taste in my mouth within 30 minutes after taking it. it didn't make me sleepy and the taste made it even harder to fall asleep. i had to end up taking 1 mg xanax to fall asleep that night."	-10
105749	"i have a lot of joint pain and swelling in my thumbs and feet. one of my toes is so swollen that i can't wear any shoes! the steroids reduce the swelling so much that i can wear my shoes again, and i'm not limping. of course, it's very temporary, but at least i can enjoy feeling normal for a few days!"	-10
102881	"this medication is nothing short of a miracle for me. i have been suffering from debilitating postpartum depression (hospitalized for 3 months) for 7 months, and no combination of ssri's/antipsychotics had worked for me until abilify. after about 4 days i began feeling happier, less suicidal. i am on 2mg in the morning. haven't noticed any real negative side effects. i almost feel &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in close to a year. love this medication."	-10
187321	"same effect as prescription medication at the same cost around $50 and has the same side effects if you have asthma and take inhaled medication you know that if you have an episode with your asthma and you use your inhaler it has the same effect nervousness, rapid heartbeat, jitters, and sometimes headache, etc. basically its just the medication opening your airways and that puts more oxygen in your lungs that makes you have the nervousness etc. if you do not have or have been diagnosed with asthma do not take this medicine until you see a dr. but i give it a thumbs up."	-10
229417	this medicine has changed my life!! i have battled depression for years. although my psychiatrist had me on more than 1 antidepressant i would still have days i would get up and be in a black hole. i never knew how long it would last - days or weeks. my diagnosis was major depressive disorder - reoccurring. i just couldn't understand with all the meds why i still struggled so much with the monster of depression. i talked to my psychiatrist about it and he started latuda. the sky is bluer the grass is greener and i know what joy is!	-10
38339	"did some, not enough, to relieve pain. i have pain because i have a ureter stent and am receiving radiation treatments to the pelvis -- both irritate the bladder and urinary track. i am searching for a similar drug to this. there must be something similar to this drug that helps alleviate the pain."	-10
204694	i am taking darvocet for an ovarian cyst. i have been on it before and has done nothing to relieve any pain i am having.	-10
177130	sporonox works so much better than other medicines or vaginal creams.	-10
193408	amrix is good for muscle cramps. it reduces pain from a 10 to a 7 for me. that is a big deal for me. i am 24/7 in pain. no medicine can reduce that pain below a 5.	-10
14747	i&rsquo;ve been on this medication for going on 3 weeks. i started it on the first day of my period and my period lasted about 4 days. i usually have severe cramps but it helped those out. but i just started bleeding again today. i&rsquo;m also having mood swings pretty badly and am nauseous all the time. it&rsquo;s made me really bloated and gassy and i&rsquo;ve never had an experience like this on any birth control pill. luckily my doctor switched my prescription earlier this week because this pill was going to cost me $166 a month.	-10
120335	"i was started on it after the first acute sudden asthma attack of my life and the inhalers weren't working... which landed me in the emergency room and had some continuing lung spasms in the weeks following this. once on it, for the first time in many years i was no longer waking up wheezing and with shortness of breath at night. it's been wonderful! fortunately, i have never had any of the side effects noted by others. i remember feeling early on that singulair may have contributed to weight gain, but it was very hard to tell as i was at that age - late 40s - when this begins to happen naturally. if so, i certainly would have preferred to not to gain weight, but the benefits of having a &quot;normal&quot; life with singulair have been fantastic"	-10
71839	i was prescribed tramadol for the arthritis pain in my hands. i had no relief from pain so i used aleve or ibuprofen which worked slightly better. i've read how some people have a significant reduction in pain when using this drug but i actually asked my doctor if it was a joke. i don't think it takes the pain away so much as it effects your thinking....	-10
101220	i was put on this medication. by doctors telling me that i heard voices. when i didn't. i was put in the hospital. by a police officer who thought i wasn't fit to drive. as i was having a diabetic hypo. he thought i was on drugs. and locked me in the hospital for 3 weeks. i was forced to have injections of invega. after this i had stabbing pains in my liver my blood sugar levels jumped i gained 15kgs. i haven't been able to orgasem. it has been 3 years since i was put on it. and 18 months since i last had it. i am still over weight. i'm now on diabetes medication. my liver is nearly 3 times the size it should be. and my sex life is over . all because of this evil medication. it should be banned.	-10
223732	i actually got xolair for chronic idiopathic urticaria. had horrible hives and was on high dose prednisone for 9 months with side effects. then got my first xolair injection. within less than 24 hours i woke up hive free. it changed my life.	-10
53099	"i've had a persistent uti and been through 2 rounds of oral antibiotics and it kept coming back despite having had a culture done to determine what would be effective. once the pain got bad enough that the pyridium was no longer effective, i called the doctor and begged for help while still waiting for the second culture results. they gave me a shot of rocephin. by morning i felt 85% better. the second day, i still feel a twinge of symptom here and there, but feel soooo much better. the shot hurts, yes. but it's not that bad, and there is was lidocaine in my injection to help with that. powerful stuff - so glad they gave it to me!"	-10
211499	"female - hiv pos since 2014 - current viral load : undetectable i've been on genvoya for about 2 months, and i love it. little to no side effects. the first week i've had mild headaches, none now that i've been on it. suspecting mild weight gain, however i could be wrong. i've only gained 5 extra lbs : may or may not be the medicine. love genvoya *"	-10
210084	how come the makers of this drug don't mention the weight gain associated with taking it? it works well for about a week and then the bloating and weight gain sets in. more than very disappointing and shame on them!	-10
211452	"i'm brown skin and tri luma didn't work for me. as soon as i started to use tri luma i notice my dark spots was beginning to become darker, i was very upset with the result of my dark marks becoming darker after a week i discontinue to use. i think that this product is only for light skin people."	-10
51082	"took the 2 gram powder 2 hours after a meal and a little over an hour, i felt like i was going to die. i violently vomited, but the doctor told me that most of the medicine was already in my system and not to worry. he told me that feeling this terrible is actually quite common with this antibiotic, especially with this high dose. i actually had to return to the hospital where i got it because i wasn't sure what was going to happen to me. i'm on day 4 and these are the symptoms i am feeling: constant upset gi tract, stomach along with acid reflux, feeling hot, mainly in the face, feeling a little more tired than usual. i'm not experiencing diarrhea, but each time i pass stool, it feels like it is going to be diarrhea. never again..."	-10
4263	"i have lost 127 pounds over the last 3 years. i used belviq as one part of my process. it definitely helped reduce my hunger and i didn't experience the side effects some people describe. but it only worked for me if i stayed with my plan - weight watchers for keeping track of weight loss, weighing my self every day, exercising - about 45 minutes every day. what i have learned is that there is no &quot;dieting&quot;. it is a life long process of accepting that i cannot live like i had been and finding great ways to enjoy food and movement - not a life long deprivation, a lifelong change for the better. i wiill continue to take belviq, i gave it 8 out of 10 because it is $89 a month and that is a significant amount for me."	-10
69273	"this medication made me feel dizzy, tired, muscle weakness and cramping. i felt un well daily."	-10
91470	"i have been on arimidex for 5 years. no pain or problems, and with a vitamin d supplement, i have been feeling great! didn't have any problems until i started the generic form."	-10
75844	"restoril really helped me sleep. sleeplessness was the cause of fibromyalgia for me and my rheumatologist prescribed it and i was able to sleep and deal with physical pain. what he did not tell me at all was the potential dangers of it. do not drink and take it. you could die because it can cause your respiratory system to shut down. if you have taken it a long time, do not wean yourself off abruptly. you could have seizures. i am being slowly weaned off of it by a doctor who is alternating dosages from 15 mg. to 30 mg. per night. i plan on giving myself plenty of time to get off of it. be careful which medicines you use with it such as anti-inflammatories. they can increase the effects of the medicine without your expecting it."	-10
111242	"ok, i had taken my 29th pill the day i had my blood work. the blood work came back negative after my 28th pill of harvoni. yes! this medicine works! i got 25 more days left of taking it. i am so glad we have the technology to beat this! now we just need a cure for cancer!"	-10
195634	"i switched to this one after being on another pill for six months. i switched because i gained 20 pounds in 6 months. i gained 5 pounds in three months with this one, but the worst part was the absolute emotional roller coaster i was on. i was cranky beyond belief a week before my period, worse than my normal pms. i encourage people to give it a shot anyway. you never know it it will work for you!"	-10
39998	"started week 4 : 2 pills am/2 pills pm severe thyriod, autoimmune and hashimotos. -5'9 | 183 | bmi 27 -plant protein shake, two salads with protein daily, and with healthy snacks in between -still hungry after meals -no weight loss in three weeks -food and sugar cravings very present -alcohol cravings present -dry mouth -odd after taste through the day -severe nausea, bloating and cramping -constipation -trouble falling asleep and then not getting quality sleep i plan to stick this out 8 weeks, then i'm out."	-10
117395	"two big toes infected, 1 year and &gt; 10 years. whole nail rotting on both. one month on jublia so far. looking clear now, and just need to see how they grow out. the first week of jublia my feet were immersed in water many hours a day in neoprene booties while kayaking. i think that helped to kill the fungus, and allowed the medication to deeply penetrate the nail. i also used a pedicure tool to keep all areas of the cuticle and under the nail clean. i put the medication on once a day, never missing a day, after a good soak in water."	-10
167551	"i have 3 children my youngest being 3 months old, my husband planned for a vasectomy in february so in the mean time i had skyla placed just a month ago. worse pain i have ever felt and i had natural labor before, i spotted for a week then it stopped , then these unusual cramps started where i would have to stop what ever i was doing and breathe throu the pain, it was awful. i made an appointment with my ob to check it out and a week before it the pains stopped so i cancelled it. today was my month check up to make sure the iud was placed correctly still, well it moved and i have to have it surgically removed , i would not recommend this to anyone not even my worse enemy."	-10
55159	"(continued) so i went to my dr. asked to try the medication. i have to say, just because it works for someone you know doesnt mean it is gonna work for you. you lose wt or you lose money, either way, stay positive for your self and for those that had good experience. i am on my 3 day. scared at 1st, cause i am taking other med for anxiety, depression and concentration. i have not had an issue with any side effects. i do make sure i drink water. i have to force myself to eat. training myself to put snacks in front of me. so, definitely curbs the appetite. coming from a woman who is not afraid to eat. i had a problem eating. i would eat till i was miserable and bloated. so far not even close. hope to see good results. working out 40min/day"	-10
230314	doesn't work at all for me. i'm still in pain wish i can find something to ease my sore and paining lower back an legs.	-10
38392	"i had this iud put in almost two years ago. pro: i'm not pregnant. cons: constant spotting still to this day, no sex drive, can feel it every now and then, and my boyfriend can feel it but has gotten used to it. i'm not sure why everyone says it hurt to be put in, because mine didn't. i did have to go back to have the string cut even more because it actually started to come out of me. personally - i wouldn't recommend getting this product. i will be taking mine out as my boyfriend has realized how annoying the spotting is. can't wear any cute underwear because you never know when the spotting will start up and not having a sex drive is a killer. why have an iud if you don't even have a sex drive..?!"	-10
135053	"holy hell is exactly how i feel. i had been taking brisdelle for 1.5 years. the hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact noven was acquired by yet another pharmaceutical company - you can't place a rep in the area, distribute your drugs, and then fire her-and not replace therefore there is no medicine or support here. you dumped this drug in the dr's hands and walked away. after calling sebula - you act like you don't even care. you have made it impossible to obtain this. i happen to think this is illegal. i just decided to wean myself off this and premarin. it has been nothing short of a nightmare. if you don't need this drug- don't start. seriously."	-10
154485	"i have been on this medicine for almost 2 months. on the plus side it lowered my blood pressure effectively. my readings are excellent! now the minuses. i always feel lightheaded and dizzy. my mouth feels dry and i keep feeling like i have to clear my throat. everyday around 2:45 i become extremely tired and nod off. it is hard to fight through this. i constantly feel queasy. 5 days ago around the same time i started feeling extremely nauseous and began to sweat heavily. when i stood up to go to the bathroom i felt dizzy to the point i strongly thought i was going to pass out. my vision also became blurry. i sat on the floor, then laid down. within 1 minute the feelings subsided. i think this is the medicine doing this."	-10
19275	"taking lyrica hasn't helped my fibrmyalgia symptoms at all, and even though i'm on a starter dose of 75 mg once per day the side effects are terrible! i tremble so badly it appears as if i have parkinson's disease. i can't hand write at all and let alone many other daily functions. it has affected my thinking terribly and makes my mind race and my thoughts are very jumbled which makes me feel extremely anxious, plus when talking my speech is very shaky sounding and very fast and slurry. i also have a lot of trouble urinating. i find it extremely difficult to empty my bladder and at times very painful. i was already taking sleeping tablets ( temazipan), but lyrica has made getting to sleep even worse. my chest and nose both feel congested."	-10
52942	i have had migraines for about 12 years. maxalt is the only drug that works and it works fast. only problem is my insurance will only pay for 10 a month and when my cluster headaches come i eat through them like candy.	-10
90482	i've been using it for 4 days and hasn't made the sores any better only worse . waste of my hard earned money .	-10
191661	"my daughter just turned 7 years old and we started her on vyvanse about 2 months ago as she was diagnosed with adhd. after two months (this week) i called the doctor and stopped the medication as she has lost so much weight from not eating, and was sleeping all the time! my daughter never took naps and would wake up at 6:30 a.m. religiously every morning on her own, but after we started her on the medicine, she falls asleep standing up and cannot wake her up in the mornings. we fight just to get her to eat things she likes and to no prevail. i know it might not be the medicine for her and in fact i am going to try a non-stimulant adhd medication before we stop these medicines over all."	-10
208968	"been on ambien for five years, created tolerance and dependence. the doctor have me belsomra. used it for two months, helped me wean off the ambien, but not at all to help me with my insomnia. now trying trazadone, and it works for me."	-10
141977	"i have taken this for about two months now and it has worked wonders for my anxiety. i also have depression and panic disorder, so it seems to help with both. the only downside i have experienced is decreased sexual interest, but my wellbutrin has seemed to help with this a bit."	-10

43669	"loseasonique works fine as birth control. i didn't get pregnant while on it but it didn't keep my period at bay for the 3 months as stated. for me, this pill actually worked the opposite way. i had a period for 3 weeks then nothing for 1 week rather than the other way around. and it wasn't just light spotting, i had bleeding similar to a period. i gave it a chance the first month and the second month, but after that i called it quits. i will have to try something else."	-10
72563	"this is a good drug for those who don't have a lot of pain, for me it is way to weak to stop the pulsating pain in my lower back, and my left leg. i have had these pains since 1987, but didn't start taking pain medication before 2000, when i couldn't stand the pain anymore. a lot of doctors says tramadol is a wonder drug- yes maybe it is, but not for those who are in real pain. as for me the best way to get control of my pain is sadly the old codeine based drugs."	-10
101921	"use to take ambien but side effect were starting to drive me nuts. nightmares, almost depressed when waking up. silenor really saved me. incredible feeling, like normal sleep. no side effects at all in my case. i'm surprised it's not more promoted."	-10
212336	"i have been on lamictal for seven years (300 mg morning and 200 mg in the evening). i had been on topamax before but my neurologist switched because of side effects. after the switch, my amount of seizures increased dramatically to about 5 per month and i was having them without any warning. it was as if i was not on any medication! i have always been controlled with medicines. the neurologist refused to believe it was from the lamictal and kept saying it was because my body had to adjust to the change in medicine. after about 6 months, a doctor at a different hospital put me on keppra in addition to the lamictal. i have only had one seizure since."	-10
177930	"i've been on this for a few months for depression and anxiety. i was on celexa for 25 years, but i also have acute bursitis and bone pain from hashimoto's disease so my doctor switched me to cymbalta. the first week i ended up in the hospital, the transition was awful i was miserable and i had severe migraines. everything smoothed out just fine and i was actually surprised at how much it did improve my bone pain and acute bursitis. i came to this site to see side effects that people are having because in the last two weeks i am finding that i am having really bad anxiety attacks at night, even while i'm sleeping; they wake me up. i had four episodes last week and another last night."	-10
33174	"i went on this pill to help with heavy periods. i have gained weight, i have blurred vision and my body aches constantly. i took myself off this pill. this is my body and i know what works for me. i will have to figure out which is worse heavy cycle or side effects."	-10

206040	rebif is effectively the indian rope trick and very dangerous. all beta interferons cause more harm to the weak body than doing any good. the pharmaceutical lobby sponsors clinical trials and whitewashing the results in relative numbering so they can sell the poisonous drugs. the drugs inflict harm to: - thyroid - blood - kidney - liver - at long intake risk possibly that your body develops anti bodies against beta interferon and might attack your body's own interferons google on the web for the avonex trial that was rigged and initially the nhs health care in the uk banned the medication to be financed. it did cost the nhs 700 million gbp for a drug that holds off a single relapse in 14 years.	-10
96121	"i hear amazing reviews on this ssri, but i cannot relate. i am 23 and i love to work out. zoloft left me zombified with erectile dysfunction. after coming off of celexa and trying this ssri i'm pretty sure ssri's aren't for me. i could not move from my couch and the x-box. i sat there for days no longer wanting to take care of myself (clean, eat) and i was getting fat. i would speed home every day after work just so i could get to my couch. i slept constantly and binged when i forced myself off the couch. i was lifeless. it brought reality to my world which was amazing! but i didn't have any energy to enjoy it."	-10
230804	"i took micardis on and off for over two years. it caused me to have leg cramps. it controlled my blood pressure, but i would avoid taking it at times because of the leg cramps. i developed severe hip and leg pains, which i think may have been caused by the micardis. i have switched to another blood pressure medicine in the last couple of months and i'm hoping the hip and leg pains will continue to subside."	-10

84916	"this was the first brand of oral birth control i tried. within an hour of taking it, i experienced awful pains in my uterus and spine. it was my normal period pains x100. i also became so nauseous and sick because of it that i had to take time out."	-10
152417	"i took one dose and within about 3 hours the blood started to clear from the urine and pain lessened; however, soon i got a bad headache, nausea, and chills. within about 12 hours from the first (and only)dose i was in the hospital--vomiting and feeling miserable. was there for 3 days taking a different antibiotic and fluids by iv. one week later bad diahrrea, and pain in knee joint. must be allergic to cipro--will remember that for sure!"	-10
171674	"i have tried other medicines before and had a terrible reaction. could no longer battle my depression and anger and decided to get on something. scared out of mind to try it, i was actually thrilled that i didn't have any bad reactions. if you have tried other medicines zoloft, lexapro and had a bad experience (like i did), then i would definitely give this one a try."	-10
33380	"i took this pill for three months. that's all i could take as it completely ruined my skin! it gradually got worse and worse and now i have horrible scars that make me want to just cry. i will say, the acne was my only downfall with this pill. it prevented pregnancy and i felt completely myself and non hormonal - but it ruined my skin in three months. my acne stopped as soon as i quit the pill"	-10
164724	"this has definitely helped my irritable bowel syndrome symptoms which are horrible gas pain, and foul smelling flatulence. it is not perfect and i did go off it to try linzess but that did not work at all so went back to librax. i have started adding miralax and citrucel because i think this ibs may be constipation related. i take 2-3 per day."	-10
25075	"knee surgery in march for(i was told)severe arthritis and two meniscus tears. the recovery and therapy was awful! my doctor kept giving me cortisone shots, then he suggested the synvisc, i finished the synvisc treatments in july and i still have horrrible pain daily! i can't sleep through the night without the pain, unable to stand on my own without holding on to something, and every visit to a store, i look for a basket, just to have something to hold on to. the surgery was a fail and all the doctor will say is &quot;you had extensive arthritis, i had to do a lot of work once i got inside of your knee&quot;. i am no longer able to straighten my knee out, i can't walk straight which has now thrown my back out of whack! it didn't work!!!!!!!!"	-10
122261	"i started effexor xr about a year ago for ptsd, and severe depression, and sleep issues. all other depression medicines (prozac, lexapro, you name it) were leaving me feeling druggy - so i was not very good at taking my medicines. i have been consistent with effexor this whole time, with very good progress, and suicidal events eliminated. i have just been increased from 75mg to 150mg to aide in fms. i am very happy with what effexor has done for me."	-10
150721	"i've had a very long history of uti's. i'm 15 &amp; i usually have a really bad urgency to pee, bloody urine &amp; unbearable burning in my bladder. my doctor usually describes bactrim &amp; say i take it @ 4pm i won't have anymore symptoms at maybe 6pm. but i do lose my appetite, &amp; i feel bloated with bad cramps. i don't care just as long as it gets rid of the uti."	-10

98207	"i absolutely love nexplanon. i had mine inserted at the end of january 2015, so it's been about 5 months. yes at first your period is gonna be all outta wack, but i haven't had a period in about two months and i love it!!!!! i did have a little mood swings at first but they subsided. no i did not gain weight, and no i did not lose my sex drive. it's even helped cleared up some acne! highly recommend this to any female wanting to stop taking the pill. it's awesome!"	-10
144047	"i was writing this wonderful, very wordy review on this when i discovered that i have a word limit. dang. in a nutshell: i've never had so many problems with a bc. significant weight gain, headaches, nausea, fatigue/insomnia, no periods for months and then weeks of bleeding. the worst is the change in my mood. depression. i couldn't no longer trust my instincts. everyone noticed a change in my attitude. it may be a convenience to just pop a rod in your arm, but it is not worth it. i am telling you, stay away. i cannot wait to have mine removed."	-10
126773	this was my first experience with any pain medication beyond the over the counter variety. i had surgery for crohn's disease: bowel resection. due to the complex nature this required fully opening up my abdomen. i was given dilaudid through my iv every 4 hours. it totally relieved my pain. everywhere that warm glow touched the pain disappeared. after about 20 minutes i would fall asleep and would wake up an hour later. the pain free feeling would last for about 3 hours.	-10
118373	"i have never slept so well or had any withdrawal problems on this medication. this medication is a god-send. i wish i would have taken my therapist's advice and taken it sooner. being from a family of alcoholics and eventually becoming one myself i was left with no other option but this one. it was my last hope. i can say that this medication works, and works well. you think clearer and your sleep patterns return to normal. sleeping was a problem for me before. i would recommend anyone with a dependency problem to discuss this medication with their doctor or therapist."	-10
40784	"desperate for relief after 2 surgeries within 3 months of each other, i was so hopeful about this medication. i ignored the reviews and got the shot (11.75 dosage administered every 3 months). i regret my choice so much. first, the expense! even with insurance, my out of pocket was $1100. the mood swings were so bad that i became suicidal. i've gained 20 pounds that exercise and nutrition can't shed. the hot flashes were controlled by an otc called estroven. the pain did subside, but only for the 1st month after each shot (i got 2 shots total). now, the pain is back and worse than ever and i'm only on month 5 of the treatment. surgery # 3 scheduled in 2 weeks. this med is not worth the side effects."	-10
207702	this medication should be outlawed for its horrible taste!!! i couldn't finish it all. and fyi for those of you worrying about suprep not working...my doctor said some people have no results until after the second cup!	-10
130056	i just had the mirena inserted yesterday. i'm 22 years old with no kids. the procedure was very painful. i felt nauseous afterwards and felt like i was gonna pass out during it. i had major cramping and bleeding for the rest of the day. today i only have mild cramping and some spotting. so it seems to be getting better.	-10
130989	i am 20 yrs old and i had it put in in january and so far its been good. i haven't had any problems with it except some hair loss but cant really say its more than average and as for acne my face actually has been clearing up. the one downer is that i still get my period but it last up to 3 weeks but its super light. aside from that its great. this my first time ever taking birth control and its been good to me. the insertion hurt a lot - they told me it would because i haven't had kids. so it's good. i recommend it but i also tell people that its not for everyone.	-10
122928	horrible absolutely horrible. i was on low ogesteral and my pharmacy just switched it to cryselle one day. within a week a felt depressed and withdrawn and completely not myself. i felt like and would cry at the drop of a dime for no given reason. i barely made it threw one pack before i came off and actually spent a month off birth control until i could get an appointment to get a new pill. i am very sensitive to estrogen so it is possibly that i am an exception but i have never had this experience on other birth control pills.	-10
140462	"i have taken lexapro for 3 years. crippling episodes of ocd-generated anxiety and depression have been put to rest with lexapro. i am taking 40mg/day, which is higher than typical 20 mg/day for depression. the ocd itself is essentially gone, and what's left of it (mixed rituals and obsessions) can be very easily controlled and does not scare me at all. i have had no episode of major ocd/anxiety/depression for 3 years, which has never happened to before (i am 49). lexapro, together with behavioral therapy, has saved my life. i am working a great job and enjoy my family life."	-10
106689	"i have had the implant in for 8 months now. insertion was easy, and it has never caused any pain at the site. i however have experienced terrible mood swings, depression, anxiety, rapid weight gain, loss of hair, excruciating period pains including passing huge clots of uterine lining! not to mention a faint vaginal odour, random blisters on my hands, moles developing halos around them, and i now have two random white patches of hair on my scalp! my experience has been terrible and continues to be so! i have kept it in because everyone says to give it time before it starts balancing out. i hate what it's doing to me, and i am getting it out as soon as i can. i cannot recommend this product at all."	-10
17354	"took it 2 times and it gave me chest pain, nervousness and could not sleep. stopped taking it."	-10
136373	"not good. the first few days were fine though not overly impressive, after that more redness and itching. it also doesn't appear to compatible with any of the moisturizers i have tried. i've stopped using it and my face is less red and much better. $20 in the garbage, i would not recommend this to anyone. and judging by all the others with issues i'm surprised it's still on the market."	-10
13305	helped my life entirely. i'm a more productive and clinical learner now. didn't realize how bad i wasn't able to stay focused until i took this and noticed the difference. sleep and eat fine on it. after the first week that is. but the lack of appetite restlessness wasn't even that bad even then.	-10
226248	"i had a total hysterectomy and experienced terrible hot flashes. i began with a dosage of .05 but the hot flashes continued, although less severe. my doctor changed the dosage to .1 and the hot flashes are a thing of the past. i've only been on this medication for 3 months but haven't experienced any side effects so far."	-10
51719	"my skin is extremely oily, sensitive and i've been breaking out non-stop since the age of 16 (i am now 20). because of my sensitivity aczone has been really amazing because it is not drying as many other prescriptions are and i like that i was able to start using it twice a day every day from day one (with many other prescriptions i have to slowly add it every other day to my regimen). i have noticed fabulous improvements in my skin. i still break out on occasion but as long as i stick to this regularly my break outs clear up far quicker than before use. it should be noted that i have been using this in conjunction with tazorac .1. i also love that it doesn't bleach clothing or anything, which i used to hate in many other products."	-10
194214	"i have gained 12 lbs in a month! my feet/hands swell so bad that i take a water pill. i am so fatigued..no energy, get out of breath and have had several migraines lately..which is not normal for me. my pulse is low all the time and blood pressure is 135/85. i was on hyzaar for years and it worked great."	-10
70286	i have generalized anxiety disorder and suffer from emetophobia. the anxiety causes stomach upset and the fear of throwing up increases the anxiety in a vicious cycle. my psychiatrist prescribed zofran while i was trying out ssri's to help me get through the first few weeks of side effects. i am now on celexa with a lot less anxiety and only take zofran as needed! it works great it just makes me feel sleepy. haven't run into any constipation yet.	-10
98008	"i am on my 2nd shot of lupron and i am not liking the new me. everyone says after the first 6 weeks it gets better. i don't know if i can take anymore or if anyone else can take my mood swings. i am very hormonal, frustrated all the time and mad about everything. my job and family are suffering. the hot flashes are constant i am miserable. i don't think i will continue with the other shots."	-10
2496	"i wanted to try this pill because i was diagnosed with severe anemia. i'm trying to save my hemoglobin not get rid of it. i didn't bleed for the first 3 weeks, now i can't stop bleeding... huge clots, massive cramps, totally gross, and a continuous headache. i can't sleep and i crave junk food all the time. i'm almost done with my 3rd month and i bleed every day. pregnancy is not an issue in my case, i'm just trying another method in order not to have my period so much. camrese fail!"	-10
197358	"i started taking atenolol 12.5mg for my near syncope condition. i was having near fainting spells-took a tilt table test and starting feeling bad after 18 minutes. i was given a stressor around that time and then passed out. i needed more than the atenolol to be able to function and work, etc. so my cardiologist put me on 10 mg paxil. i had to up it to 20mg and have been on this cocktail of medicines for approximately 4 years now. i have some moments when i feel lightheaded but nothing severe. this has been working for me pretty well though."	-10
125162	"i bought dulcolax after being constipated for a week and googling some good medicine. i took one pill and after i took it, i came to this website and read the reviews. i got really scared! but nothing happened except for being really thirsty (drank around 2l of water). two days after, i took two tablets. i waited for a while and the cramps started: nothing much, it was painful but it wasn't unberable. 15min after the first cramps i was done. my advice: if you never took it, start with one and see how you feel. and don't get scared by reviews, everyone reacts diffently."	-10
48542	i begin this medicine because i had trouble with regulating my cycle. biggest mistake ever! i have been bleeding non stop going on three weeks and the cramps and abdominal pain is unreal. i couldn't even finish a whole month because of the side effects. i do not recommend this product at all.	-10
178932	when i first started victoria i got very sick. i waited a week and tried it again. this time i made sure i had very light food. i had bought some pudding and jello (sugar free). i also had some ginger ale on hand because that settles my stomach. started with the .6 and had nausea for the first 4 days. then felt fine. then went to the 1.2 again nausea for 4 days. now i am doing the 1.8. i have lost 13 lbs in 6 weeks and i feel great. i also have been drinking a lot of water to help with the constipation. thank-you victoza.	-10

32371	"after taking 2 lisiniprol i broke out in a horrendous red rash over my entire body. extreme itching. angioedema, difficulty swollowing, eye sight compromosied, violent headache. 3 trips to er, 3 days in hospital. 4 weeks later entire body skin peeling. still very weak, short of breath on exertion. bp elevated. not sure what i will do about bp as i am very afraid to try a new drug. this is a very bad drug."	-10
39929	"i have been on contrave for 3 months now and am down about 35 pounds. i love it! i have had absolutely no side effects at all, and once i got up to the full dose i am not hungry at all. in fact, i often have to remind myself to eat. on my doctor's advice i've actually lowered my dose back to 2 in the morning and one at night. it isn't doing it all on its own. i am also making an effort to be more active mainly through walking every day along with eating less. i want to lose 90 pounds total and am well on my way."	-10
54869	"i am on day 5 of taking contrave. i usually think about food all day and everything in between is a major inconvenience. day 5 of this medication i almost am forgetting to eat, i have more energy, my mind is quieter, i feel overall more peaceful than normal. i've lost 3 pounds already! i get full about half way through a small meal which is a big deal for me because usually my appetite is insatiable. i haven't had any of the side effects people have mentioned except that my eyes feel a little weird, which makes me feel a little dizzy, but it's barely noticeable. i have had some mild headaches but i think that's because i usually drink a lot of coffee and i haven't craved it as much so i havent had as much."	-10
22874	"i took candesartan to prevent chronic migraines. instead, it started triggering them on a daily basis. once i realized the medication was the culprit, i stopped taking it. my neuro prescribed me 10 mg amitriptyline, which stopped the daily migraines, but like another reviewer wrote, it took approximately two weeks for me to stop experiencing severe anxiety and panic caused by the candesartan. it was a horrible drug for me."	-10
22119	i have been drinking alcohol seriously for 40 years. i have stopped drinking before but always had cravings and eventually went back to drinking. this time i have not had cravings and don't even think about alcohol the majority of evenings. this has only been going a month now so take that into consideration. i read something about baclofen and alcohol withdrawal 2 days ago and recalled that my back doctor had given me a prescription for it and i have only taken it 2 or 3 times this month. i have been curious as to why i have not had any cravings. perhaps it was the few baclofen i have taken.	-10
207040	"i never write reviews but had to share my terrible experience so that others don't make the same mistake that i've made. i had been on yasmin for years, my doctor suggested i switch to a generic since it's free (as opposed to $50) so i gave it a shot for a month. i have one more day on zarah and here are the side effects i've experienced in that time: nausea, severe moodiness, dizziness, yeast infection, swollen tongue (?!), cystic acne, loss of appetite yet weight gain. i'm a healthy, active 31-year old woman without any other medical issues. avoid this pill!!"	-10
76656	"i started on belviq one week ago. i have struggled with weight my entire life. i'm active and average 9000-10000 steps a day and practice yoga once a week. i love to cook and i love to eat! 80% of my meals are healthy, but the other 20% are not. over the years i'm certain my portions of healthy food are more than i need and i binge on the junk food and drink beer. after gaining 30 pounds last year i tipped the scale at 202. i'm 5'6 45 years old. the first day i had a headache- it went away within 30 minutes. i sleep great and i'm not obsessed with food! i've stayed between 1000-1200 calories easily and have lost 11 pounds in one week. i'm eating healthy, the binging is gone and i get full faster!"	-10
37675	"i'm 17 and on 60 mg of vyvanse. i weigh about 112 lbs. i don't know if it's too high a dose, but ever since i got it increased from 50 to 60mg. i've been feeling actually tired, which is a surprise to me because it's a stimulant. i've also had more intense dizziness and headaches, and i had heart palpitations on the 50, but now they're more frequent, and chest pain, heart races, but i'm able to focus a little better."	-10

49107	"i took this bc for about 5 years it was absolutely amazing for the first four years, with the exception of having spotting here or there but once we got through about 3-6 months that ended and only getting my period ever three months was amazing! i had a very light period with little to no cramps while on this pill. about a year ago i stopped taking it after having been on it for close to 5 years. i went on vacation and continued to take my pill at the same time every day and i had my period for the entire three weeks i was gone. a very heavy and painful period too which was completely abnormal. i also completely lost my sex drive before stopping using this and have now stopped taking it and i am honestly scared to experiment with new pills"	-10
37400	"i have been on this med for 12 days, so far i haven't seen a difference, in fact i'm thinking my dr gave me a placebo. i have been very tired and sleeping more. i have tried dexedrine and concerta which i feel, worked better, but was harsh. i hope in time i will see the benefits."	-10
61277	"this medicine has helped me through allergy seasons, hives, and hay fever. most of my family uses it, too. my dad is 56 and he loves it. he goes on and on about how &quot;medicine is so advanced now-a-days&quot; and how it was &quot;back in his day&quot;. he says he has never seen anything like it and swears by it. i do, too. it's great!"	-10
76389	"been on victoza for 3 mos now and saw my dr yesterday, happy to report down 40 lbs in 3 mos and now increased to 1.8 dosage. if you can stick it out with the side effects, it does get better. i barely have any side effects anymore...not 100% gone but much better! pending for the results on my a1c reading but i feel it is much better than it was prior to this rx."	-10
60969	i took these for a couple weeks and my tummy has been hurting bad and my skin and very itchy and not sure if this is with it but i got a face yeast infection and my eyes kind of bother me.	-10

91079	i had botox for an oab. before i had a terrible urge to go but i could not fully empty but i could go ! the date is oct in april it would have been three years since i had this done. at the beginning i was reluctant but my urologist recommended this. i was told i was going to have to be totally reliant of self catheterisation which i was ok. she did however say there are instances where the botox would get rid of the urge but you would still be able to pee. a week after having botox i have been 100% reliant on catheters. without them i have urinary retention i cannot go at all. i feel totally let down by the medical profession and the company that makes this drug as they have washed their hands of me and the only suggestion is to have more botox !	-10

195195	"i'm 33 with a torn cartilage in my knee, and tons of arthritis throughout the knee. my doctor prescribed me this because i was unable to sleep at night, and move well throughout the day, cause of the severe pain in my knee. works good, just eat some crackers or pretzels first, before taking because of the slight upset stomach you will have."	-10
207413	"did the suprep last night. used a straw and plugged nose and took sips of plain water periodically during the course of drinking the prep. popped mint gum in my mouth right after. no nausea at all. took 7 minutes. if you are not used to drinking that volume of water you might want to start practicing a few weeks earlier. my work out trainer always has us drinking approx 120 ounces of water throughout the day so the volume was no problem. at the doctors office today a nurse was telling someone it's not the taste (slight grape) , it's the liquid volume that makes folks nauseous. it worked really great and was a much better / more efficient experience than the miralax."	-10
165737	"i got the kyleena yesterday. the doctor warned me about discomfort and needing to stay seated for a new minutes after. the insertion was the most painful thing i've ever experienced and i'm comparing to staples in my head. botox for migraines every 3 months and the migraines i get all the time. used to her an epipen like prescription jabbed in my leg once a week. this stuff was terrible. the doctor did not warn me it was going to hurt so bad... i jumped. i stayed laying down after it was done for about 5 mins. and then when i left, i passed out walking out the door which i was also warned about. next morning: light brown bleeding and a lot of pain. it's worth it to not take a pill every day."	-10

228708	"i've been using leflunomide since july 2007. it took 3 months for it to become effective, but i have been pain free since then! wonderful! but, i have developed chronic urinary tract infections -- 12 in the last two years. my urologist is exasperated and has about exhausted his bag of tricks; daily macrodantin (antibiotic) for over a year helped for a few months at a time, but i'm now resistant to that. i only take 10 mg leflunomide and really hate to think of doing without it, but my bladder is important too. i'm going to ask the rheumatologist this week about cutting the dosage in half."	-10
11962	i was suspicious at first. but i decided to try it out. withen the first week i had lost 5 pounds and it give you a boost of energy like you wouldnt believe. hopefully this last for a while and body doesnt get used to it quick. kind of the nature of these things.	-10

98126	"i got the arm insert because i have had bad experiences with estrogen based pills on the past and since it uses a different hormone and has little chance of adverse reactions i felt good about the decision. however i seemed to be part of the 3rd of the population that had side effects. i had a little over 3 months and it was miserable!! 5 pounds in the first week and over 15 since, not to mention the awful mood swings, i have never had a history of depression but while on it i would randomly feel miserable, like the hopeless kind of depression, i broke out and just generally wanted to crawl out of my skin, i had it removed yesterday, felt the same as going in and i'm hopeful my body will return to normal with time."	-10
159112	"i love this birth control. i've been on the pill for about 6 months and i still have no side effects, well i do eat alot. i'm now 159 lbs but that's okay. i got on this pill for birth control but mainly for acne, and it works so great. it gets worse before it gets better, i recommend this pill for everybody. try it."	-10
193006	"great medicine, i recently restarted this medicine after 10 years and i feel normal again. this medicine has given me great peace in my life. i feel calm and collected and i'm quickly understanding what its like to have &quot;free time&quot; i insist that people who find results using this medicine ensure those in government understand the increase in quality of life we are all experiencing. i've rated this medicine 10/10 purely because any cons i've experienced are meaningless compared to been given a life."	-10
83834	"i have had bleeding for over a month now and i have never had an abnormal cycle. ortho tri cyclen lo is the way to go. if it's the &quot;same&quot;, why am i experiencing different symptoms? the bigger problem ladies is why can't women choose which birth control pill they want to ingest at a reasonable cost? why is ortho now $60 under our plans especially when we are experiencing such horrific side effects. it costs the insurer more in the long run because i now have to call the gyno, go in for a check, an ultrasound etc due to abnormal bleeding versus simply giving us a choice."	-10
56395	"since being on humira, i am a whole new person. it was hard being diagnosed at 29 with a new baby to take care of. i could barely get out of bed, open a jar or change a diaper. i do have headaches often, fatigue and slight mood swings, but worth it. i have my life back."	-10
22925	"i started with the starter pack, and when i went from 10 mg to 20 mg, it was a train wreck. i actually couldn't function, my entire body was like hell no... massive fatigue, cramping in the stomach, fogginess, couldn't go to work. i feel like i had 30 beers. i hope this works out for you if you are trying it, but i'm finished with this.gl"	-10
41088	"my experience began when i was a child. i had very strange headaches, eventually diagnosed as &quot;ice pick migraines&quot; they had all the symptoms of the normal migraine you hear about, except, they were so painful, my feet would draw up, my eyes would roll back, and i went almost stiff from the pain....nothing helped. when i hit my thirties, i started having issues with my spine, my pancreas, and my kidneys. percocet is the only therapy out there that keeps me from wanting to die. my blood is thinner, and i have issues as stated, with my pancreas and stomach, so i cannot take otc drugs, they make me sick. very sick. but, of course, no one believes that until they see what happens to me. its kind of a living hell. i say if we can help, help."	-10
101283	"do yourself a huge favor and stay away from this pill. i read all the terrible reviews and still went for it. i was previously on microgestion for 6 months, it did me wonderful. when it came time to get my new packs, planned parenthood supposedly didn't carry it anymore. i was told aubra was the exact same thing and wouldn't affect me differently. what a lie that was. two weeks into my pack and i got my period again for the month. third week and i'm having terrible cramps accompanied with more bleeding. my appetite has changed, i'm not eating much. grateful i haven't experienced acne, mood changes, nausea or headaches. but don't even wanna chance it. contemplating if i should throw out the pack or finish and just drop. don't recommend!!!!!!!!"	-10
77501	"i have been taking avapro for 5 years and i don't like it so am looking for another drug. my gp thinks if the side effects are bearable don't change anything. i don't like the dizziness, cold feet, dry throat and tiredness it produces. it has also depleted my potassium levels and i wonder if the arrhythmias i have been having are related to prolonged use."	-10
144592	"i originally had the nexplanon implant fitted 5 years ago, when i was 16. shortly after, i started suffering with depression and body confidence issues and my interest in food disappeared all together. i was put on medication for this but more recently, i have started having issues such as constant bleeding with no breaks, acne, i have been placed on a stronger dose of medication for depression and anxiety for the second time as this has just gotten worse, migranes and muscle aches and pains! i would not reccomend this to any women as, for me, it's been more trouble than it's worth. now it's been removed, i feel like myself again!"	-10
197250	"huge weight gain! from 135 lbs up to 205 lbs and there didn't seem to be any way to lose the weight. i am not an eater, or a snacker, if anything i can't manage breakfast and i eat a healthy sandwich for lunch and can only manage 1/2 the meal that my husband eats at night. for me, depression = loss of appetite."	-10
115461	"just received a d&amp;c today and had to be put to sleep with propofol and i must tell you it is amazing. i was so scared to be put under because this was my first surgery. i'm 21. the anesthesiologist talked to me the whole time. when the medication was injected into my iv it wasn't painful but it did go up my shoulder and i could actually taste it but after that all i remember was looking at the clock and them strapping me down on the surgery table and then i was in recovery. it's that simple. it's just like a regular nap. i woke up tired but no nausea, i wasn't groggy, no headache. i felt great. would definitely do this medicine again. hope this helps for those who are afraid like i was. don't be. it's as easy as 123."	-10
148707	"pros: discreet, no pregnancies for 5 years, no daily pill reminders, covered by insurance. cons: bv like clockwork! my period remained the same ( 5 days) which could be a pro for some. **prior to mirena i was on the pill. after my first child i knew i wanted to go long term birth control. apparently it works but i just can't deal with the constant bv. when i have intercourse with my husband he can feel the strings inside. if you have a sensitive system like myself, i'd look into other forms of birth control first."	-10

118742	"this pill ruined my life a few years ago and i wouldn't want anyone else to go through it. it was a nightmare from the beginning. i threw up constantly (while still gaining a ridiculous amount of weight very quickly). i went from having clear, clean skin to it looking like i had a disease. it took over a year after stopping the pill for my face to clear up. i became paranoid and depressed while having violent and unpredictable mood swings. i cried every single day. i eventually had to drop out of school because i couldn't control my moods. horrible pill pushed by a horrible doctor."	-10
212297	"lamictal has changed my life. i started on lamictal 2 1/2 months ago and i can't believe the clarity and happiness in my day to day life. for years, i have been on various antidepressants. i had never been to a specialist, only my primary care physician to discuss the problem. i got to a point when i couldn't remember when i was happy and felt normal. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but no mention of bi polar. my severe mood swings were affecting everything in my life. my relationship with my husband, kids, my lack of motivation. i felt like there was a constant cloud over my head, when i had nothing to be depressed about. the psychiatrist i went to diagnosed me with bipolar and started the lamical."	-10
163408	"concerta has helped me tremendously in school. my grades skyrocketed after only one semester of use. the first day, when i was on 18mg, i could already feel the effect. now, i only take concerta (27mg) on school days and other days which i know are going to be exhausting. even on the days i don't take it, i feel happier than before. concerta gives me motivation so i can actually live, which makes my motivation stick around. i can now socialise without feeling like my energy has been sucked out of me after one conversation. i can now do my homework and chores. i do things in my free time, instead of crashing in bed after a day of school. though my appetite changed, and i lost a lot of weight, i have a lot to thank concerta for."	-10

20241	"first time i took macrobid for uti, after a few days i developed flu like symptoms, fever, aches and pains, heart racing, bronchial congestion. after the infection came back i took it again and only one dose brought back all the side effects and more. i went on line to see if i was alone and i am one of many with this reaction and worse. thank god for the internet."	-10
214886	"recently diagnosed with ms (december, 2015 - 3 months ago) the ms specialist at uthsc san antonio prescribed ampyra. i had extreme weakness in my right leg and some weakness in my right ankle, causing some problems walking and forcing me to cut way back on my biking and to go to traditional flat pedals as i could no longer work my foot well enough to use single entry clip in road bike pedals. started ampyra march 8, 2016 and within 48 hours i noticed a huge difference in leg function. it's now been two weeks and i'm back to using clip in pedals (mtb dual entry alas) on my bike and up to 30 miles per ride @ 15 mph, up from 20 miles @ 10 mph. that's a true quantitative measurement of improved function. don't wait to try this stuff."	-10

136668	"don't bother wasting your time with euflexxa. i have been diagnosed with moderate osteoarthritis and euflexxa only made my condition worse. now i am stuck with a sore back, i can hardly bend over, my limbs have no flexibility and are sore as heck. i don't get it. the treatment did not even come close to doing what is was described as. my doctor told me that the fluid only stays in your knee about two days and then it is gone. it is not described that way on the euflexxa web site. it says it hardens into a gel then forms a cushion between your bones. my experience is that this is not true. and how much am i paying for this ??? don't bother spending your money on euflexxa. your money is better spent on a partial or full knee replacement."	-10
134483	"my doctor prescribed this to help with my ulcerative colitis. it has definitely helped and now i'm gradually going off of it. i too experienced a big acne breakout after starting on prednisone. i felt like i was in high school again!! however, i'd rather have the breakouts then the side effects of ulcerative colitis."	-10
219526	"i began taking birth control to help control my heavy bleeding and cramping. i was on a lower dose birth control, norethindrone/eth 24 fe, for 8 months and it was amazing until i started to have break through bleeding. my obgyn switched me to this to stop the bleeding. i'm a sunday starter and the switch between the two was hard for my body and resulted in a full month of bleeding. the periods lightened/shortened with this pill, but i started getting a ton of side effects i never had before; such as nausea, headaches, constant aching during periods, bloating, weight gain around my stomach area, and constipation. the pill worked to prevent pregnancy ( condoms) and in reducing flow, but with the added side effects it wasn't worth it to stay."	-10
16361	"after two weeks i couldn't take it. my nerves felt so thin every little normal everyday snafu became an emotional overload. i was angry in a flash at at work, and also on the road while driving, making me realize how unsafe and untenable my life had seemed to become. i would also randomly feel like crying at work which only created extra stress to try to keep calm. after a couple different sick days where i tried to relax and integrate the medicine, i realized with intuition it just wasn't all in my head. so i stopped and felt more normal soon after. i was also bloated and nauseous while taking it. my advice is try it if you want but if you start having emotional problems don't wait around trying to adjust or assume it's all in your head."	-10
66283	"until about age 56, had never had cold sore. suddenly had spot on butt, went to clinic, pa thought it was spider bite, antibodies given, no relief. the next time it occurred (same spot), got in to see dermatologist immediately. he stated it was a form of chicken pox virus (not sexual related). gave valtrex, worked great. pharmacist also recommending taking l-lysyine daily to help prevent occurrences. used to have only 2 occurrences a year - february and august -my work stress months. have not had any more occurrences."	-10
77260	"the lack of food interest lasts all the next day until about 2:30 or so. i have been losing about 2-3 pounds a week. it's so easy. i track my diet with the fitbit app. i'm about 1000 cals/day. i make sure my diet is healthy and balanced, but i can take food or leave it. no cravings! none. i feel fabulous. have lost ten pounds, no sweat. best thing ever for me! no side effects any more."	-10
49053	i was on chateal for 4 months and i didn't like it. i was always moody and very emotional. i was always feeling depressed and i didn't like that. i'm normally a happy person so when i started feeling this way. i immediately wanted to switch birth control. only thing i liked about was that i had an appetite and was able to gain weight like i wanted too unlike the other birth controls i've taken. i didn't like being moody all the time so i switched to the depo shot and i've been so much happier.	-10

50425	for a long time i have believed that i was bipolar but never took medicine for it. a couple years ago i started taking gabapentin for a herniated disk. i immediately noticed a feel good feeling. that is now the main reason i continue to take it. people are warned to not stop taking this abruptly..they mean it! i recently had surgery to remove my fibroids and i stopped taking gabapentin due to all the other medicines i was having to take. shortly after stopping abruptly my husband said something to me i didn't like that hurt my feelings and i threw a plate of food at him! i have never in my life done this. afterwards i found out that anxiety is also a symptom of abruptly stopping meds. make sure to wean off slowly.	-10
96894	"i've been using qvar for about two weeks. i used advair before for years, and though it was extremely effective in treating my asthma, it kept making me lose my voice, so my doctor suggested trying qvar. i happen to be out of my albuterol inhaler until i see my doctor later this week, so i'm experiencing qvar with no backup system, and i find it to be very ineffective against my asthma. i'm using it twice a day, two puffs each time, as prescribed, and though it doesn't make my asthma worse, it doesn't appear to improve it either. except for short spurts during the middle of the day, which might just be incidental. anyway, i'm going to ask my doctor for another alternative to advair because qvar's just not working."	-10

65323	"it was terrible. i took it years ago when it first came out. yasmin 28, i think. my mood was down, i had upset stomach all the time. i couldn't handle diary or fats. i always felt anxious. i told my gyno, he shrugged it off as normal. then the tipping point was when i was on the bus and i started feeling lightheaded and then lost my vision. a friend helped me off the bus where i had to sit and breathe in the cool fall air in order to regain my composure and slowly my vision came back. i stopped the pill immediately after that. my peroid only came back 3 months later and it took years before it was on track again. i went online and many women had same issues and had trouble starting a family after stopping the pill. dangerous stuff."	-10
115684	"i have had psoriasis for 30 years. i've used many topical ointments, light therapy, and embrel. i've also tried many home remedies and recommendations; however, nothing worked to clear my skin and my arthritis got worse. i started cosentyx and after 3 weekly shots, my skin started clearing, by my second monthly shot, my skin was completely cleared everywhere! my arthritis is already much better after the 3rd monthly shot and hardly noticeable at all. if you are a candidate, i highly recommend this course of therapy. the shots are barely painful (i am a wimp)."	-10
106460	"my first implant went extremely well. i got it put in during my period, which is usually heavy. the next time i had it the flow was noticeably less. after when they would come it slowed till it eventually stopped. i went 2 years period free but when it got close to the time to take it out my period was radically crazy. i would spot then stop the next day or get a heavy flow then the next week spot again. i noticed even before these symptoms that i would get a slight shock or ache where the implant was put but to me this was fine. i got it taken out and was off it for a year before getting another. this time my period is now hitting its two weeks. so i'm going to switch to depo to see if that works better. they say to switching bc helps."	-10
213306	"since starting on nuvigil, i have yet to take my afternoon nap. i take nuvigil each afternoon around 12:30 which will last until 9 pm, right when i'm about to hit the bed. works like a magic. but i still need something to give me extra boost. however, i feel 90% recovery. it also helps with concentration but not much. does make you feel good."	-10

149081	"had insertion one week ago. i have never had a kid and my doctor did not warn me how painful it was going to be. she said some pressure and cramping was normal, but when she did it and noticed how buckled over in pain i was she called the pain &quot;mini labor&quot; because it dilates the cervix momentarily and said the cramping should pass in 30 minutes. it did not. i wish i had known it was going to debilitate me so much that i wouldn't be able to work 3 hours later. make sure your parent, friend, or significant other are there with you to take you home if you have it inserted and have never had kids. i immediately bought a heating pad to help with the cramping pain i have had since insertion. i use icy hot patches at work to distract the pain."	-10
77302	"started out after christmas 19.75lbs later. i am sold and yes is does stop snacking, drinking and helps with a lot of your blood work. i had my doubts but results are just nice. i am paying out of pocket but the savings in other areas and feeling healthy are worth every penny."	-10

82511	"this medication isn't that effective compared to taking norco since norco releases most of its metabolytes within an hour immediately causing pain relief. switching over to hysingla has not only cost me way more money per month but also has caused me to have severe withdrawals and pain to due it's very slow time release of the medication. i take 20 mg of norco at a time tid and i'm on the hysingla 30mg. so with that being said, my body is used to 20mg of morphine every 6 hours. if i'm on the hysingla 30, it means i'm only getting approximately 1.25mg an hour. that causes the concentration of my morphine levels to drop rapidly. bottom line, this medication does not work unless you have minor pain that can wait a while till this medication"	-10
184587	"i have ptsd with flashbacks/anxiety and don't want to take benzodiazepines because i'm also an addict. while vistaril doesn't work quite as well, it does help and i feel better about taking it."	-10

64072	"i've been on 25mg of zoloft for 7 days now and during that time i had 3 good days and 4 bad days. thus is actually pretty good since i haven't had a good day in 2 months. based on other reviews and the general use, i'm very lucky to seeing some good days since they say it could take 2 weeks and between 50 and 200mg. i'm hopeful i don't have to go up and continue the horrible ride i've been on trying different antidepressants and benzos which i blame for a lot of my anxiety."	-10
72113	"i have been on tramadol for 6 yrs. for herniated discs as well as spondyliolisthesis which causes severe sciatica. it has been a godsend as narcotics did nothing for the sciatica and are awful all the way around. it also helps my mood and is a good replacement for antidepressants with absolutely no side effects. the only downside for me is the tolerance factor. i have to take more now for the same effect, 100 mg 2x/day instead of 50 mg 2x/day."	-10
173523	"i thought i was going crazy. taking aromosin for 11 mos. i fall asleep in the middle of the day, even nod off when i'm with friends. terrible sleeplessness, hand joint pain in middle of night, thinning hair (after losing hair after chemo), the fatigue makes me lack motivation, no interest in anything, poor eating habits, can't exercise, don't want to do anything. this is worse than arimidex!"	-10
151288	these pills are amazing. nothing has ever worked the way they do on my back. i have had 3 surgeries and i will always be in pain but with these i can at least function and thats all i can ask for.	-10

161767	"i am taking this medication in combination with thorazine, i take the remeron at night due to the sleepiness, the thorazine in the day and also in combination at night. i was not aware of the weight gain effects of the remeron, but now i realize that both are causing weight gain. as far as the help with sleeplessness, this has been the only one that has helped."	-10
206527	"shortly after beginning diovan, i started coughing, and it just never stopped. little by little, it increased to the point, that i just couldn't take it anymore. i still have a lingering cough, but not as bad as when i stopped. i am hoping it will stop completely with time. i wish i had known it was a common side affect before i started using it. now i am afraid to take a different med for high blood pressure, until i research it thoroughly."	-10
112260	"i was diagnose with tn (trigeminal neuroglia) a debilitating pain disorder/disease. the pain started on the left side of my face, temple then traveled down to my left eye and the worse pain of all was the feeling of nerve pain throughout my gums and teeth. i wanted the dentist to removed them but it wasn't dental problem. i have 3 blood vessels from the brain laying on trigeminal nerve, the pain was like nothing i've experience. i literally could commit murder. i've been on these meds since the middle of december and it took 2 weeks to finally kick in and i couldn't be happier. side affects works different with everyone guess. i've heard horror stories. with me it's a bit of drowsiness thank goodness! good luck all."	-10
169284	i had diprivan for a colonoscopy. i was out instantly and the procedure was completely painless. i woke up very quickly afterwards and felt great. i would recommend diprivan for colonoscopy!	-10
228839	i buy cialis online for a tiny fraction of what you pay in australia. i buy 20mg tablets for 20 cents each then quarter them. they work good for bph and ed. the pharmacy industry is rolling us over a barrel.	-10
45595	prozac was not the medicine for me. i was put on prozac for depression. i actually began to feel worse when i took it. i also developed a bad case of ocd taking prozac to the point that i plucked my eyebrows completely off. i also felt very anxious all the time and scared. so my doctor took me off prozac and switched me to lexapro and it did wonders. i am a lot happier and confident now. i no longer have ocd and my eyebrows have since grown back. my advice to people who are not seeing results with prozac is to switch to lexapro. i wish i would have long ago. i haven't been this happy in years.	-10

142403	"i just had my iud inserted about 2 weeks ago and i am loving it! right after insertion i was very light headed and threw up. but i'm not sure if it was due to the insertion or because i also just had the implant removed from my arm. so far only had cramping on the first night and super light spotting here and there. no mood swings, acne or weight gain unlike nexplanon and i feel like myself again! easy and effective birth control, would definitely recommend to anyone looking to switch!"	-10
91153	"one week after botox treatment, i was and still am miserable. i have had utis and urinary retention. following a trip to the er, i was fitted with a catheter, which was pretty uncomfortable. next came self catherization, which has been nearly impossible, due to my bulging bladder. i would rather wear depends than go through this ongoing nightmare. i resent the fact that my doctor only mentioned retention casually and did not explain the consequences."	-10
190204	i guess hormonal bc isnt for me. i switched to otc lo after being on alesse 28 for 3 months. i was beginning to get acne on alesse and it was impacting my mood. my gp recommended i try this bc because apparently it's good for acne. well...this bc made my acne worse. literally ruined my chin with painful zits and now horrible scars. my depression has gotten worse and my anxiety is through the roof. i have an appetite that is endless and gained so much weight. also my period happens before the placebo week which is odd. i absolutely hate this pill and wish i never started birth control at all. as far as birth control it does its job but the side effects are not worth it.	-10
192358	"i've been using yaz for almost two months and i won't be continuing with this pill. almost immediately after i changed from qlaira to yaz i noticed my anxiety levels rising, i'm not one to constantly worry and have always had this joy for life, but not since taking yaz. i don't even feel like waking up and doing what i love. my sex drive is very, very, very low and i'm very dry down there. i'm very moody and fight with my fiance on a daily basis. my breasts have gone up an entire cup size and they are really tende. i have severe abdominal pains and nausea. i cannot wait to start a different pill."	-10
25710	i gained weight from the depo shot. i was extremely sick on the pills. the ortho evra patch was a gateway to happiness. i had multicystic ovaries that made life uncomfortable for me from random pains and swelling to uncomfortable sex. i tried many different contraceptives and the patch is the only one that helped. my only complaints is the residue from the patch breast tenderness (although i did go up a size and my sex drive went way up). my husband hides from me now haha. make sure you use as directed. skipping a few days on the switcharoo will throw your period off.	-10
16030	"i started taking this birth control 4 months ago. i immediately developed acne all over my face, gained 20 pounds over the course of 2 months, suffered from debilitating cramps, and experienced intense mood swings. i do not recommend this birth control for anyone who is estrogen dominant."	-10
98206	the nexplanon is a great device in the sense that once its inserted you dont have to worry about drinking anything each day or making appointments for shots. its good for 3 years and its not noticeable. i had my nexplanon for a year before i took it out. the first 3 months i bleed every single day. after the 3 months i didn't get my cycle for another 3 months and then suddenly got my cycle after those months and i never stopped bleeding after that. i was put on a bc pill to see if i could stop the bleeding and it just made it worst and heavier. it was horrifying . i do not recommend	-10

116664	"i've been on this medication for 1 year or even 2 years with 300 mg. i still have extreme mood swings and it doesn't help at all, i want lithium or other bipolar medicine - this doesn't work at all for me. i'm really scared to gain weight while on some other medication because i already gained 20 kg from an antipsychotic medicine before but i can live with this. my bipolar illness gets worse and worse i still have a good medicine &quot;base&quot; tho. it's not as extreme as a couple of years ago but i'm only 19 years old so i'm looking forward trying something else."	-10
163808	i was prescribed mirtazapine after trying a few other anti-depressants with bad results. i suffer from depression and bipolar type 2. i found the mirtazapine helped me to sleep. after a few days of being on it did increase my appetite but this is usually over come with will power. i take my 45mg tablet at night so i guess that's what helps for sleep and in the morning i take a does of lamictal for my mood. after being on this medicine for a few months now i can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel and realize the black dog may become a thing of the past hopefully. thanks mirtazapine.	-10
139625	etodolac did a great job on my knee pain. unfortunately possibly due to my crohn's disease also caused extreme diarrhea and gas. i had to discontinue use.	-10

203711	"i have severe insomnia. i wanted to try a new drug because my dr. suggested it. no way will i take another 10 mg tablet. it took 2 hours to take effect. i started feeling sleepy so i crawled into bed. within 30 min of laying down, my body was unable to move but my mind was racing. i tried to tell my husband what was happening and i couldn't get the words out. it lasted about 10 hours. i had a hard time getting up. i have been confused and foggy all day. i will never do it again."	-10
211543	"i took genvoya for about 3 weeks... i had to stop. i was regularly having numbness on the left side of my body. in addition to that, i was having what felt like small stinging sensations all over my body (mainly in my stomach and back). i also developed a skin irritation that i'm still fighting to get rid of. i really regret switching to this med."	-10
106372	i got the implanon october 2016 and have had it now for 3 months. the first 2 months i had light bleeding from my period for 3 days and no period for the rest of that month. this month i have bled nonstop for the whole month and its bright red signaling no sign of going off. implanon seemed to be a good idea at first but with these periods i cannot do it anymore. i'm having it taken out this week.	-10
188636	"i had my para guard inserted in 2008 in which has been removed in 2013. i have pains during intercourse, cramps, heavier periods. even today, 2015, i still have pains. i feel like it has ruined my sex life."	-10
123371	i have been on apri since last year and i absolutely love apri. my doctor prescribed it for three packs in a row therefore i only get my period four times a year and i have no spotting and no issues with my period when it comes. this pill is much better than my last. i have no complaints i love it.	-10
184258	"for anyone taking this medication, do not take it with any kind of antidepressants or mood medication like celexa, zoloft, tegretol, xanax, or abilify. definitely do not take it with ambien. it works wonders by itself, i've been on it since 2005 it helps with the anxiety symptoms i get from my ptsd. anytime i feel disoriented or way to anxious where i'm throwing up, it usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes to work. but it's better than the feeling of thinking that you are having a heart attack, because it's just panic. panic attacks can be managed many ways i use breathing techniques, (child breathing will not work lol) meditation, and medication. this is how i deal with that small aspect of my ptsd psychosis."	-10
192336	"worst birth control ever. i started taking it after my doctor thought i would get pregnant.... even though condoms are used. i've been on it for 1 1/2 weeks now and my body rejects the pill by vomiting it back up. i've had a really bad acne breakout and i have started to get panic attacks so bad that it's hard to physically and emotionally function. at this point, i'd rather go through 9 months of pregnancy and a million hours of labor than take this."	-10
203045	"this pill did tremendously help with my cramps and lighten my period. but i have thought i was losing my mind since i started it. very depressed all the time, extreme highs and way more extreme lows, my skin has never broken out like it has since starting this pill, i've gained almost 40 pounds no matter how i cut back and exercise more i can't get rid of it (something i've never had a problem with), my hair is literally falling out, i'm so achy and sore all day everyday, and i don't even know what sleep is anymore. funny enough i didn't connect any of these symptoms to this pill even though it all didn't start until after i started this pill, it was just another sleepless night on the net. i'll just deal with the cramps, not worth it"	-10
59768	"i don't normally do these but i have to share what i went through on the nuvaring so that maybe it can help someone else understand more about it. i had been taking the nuva for 2+ years with no complaints. i was/am currently in a monogamous relationship. very happy. we've been together for many years now but we're still quite young. (early 20s) one thing that was never reliable was our sex life. i desired him and vice versa, but i was just never in the mood. this went on for a couple years and all along i thought it was me. many fights came out of this. long story short, i ran out of refills and went a few weeks without and realized the nuva was surpressing my libido. it almost cost me my relationship. take from that what you will."	-10
16737	"i just want to say thank you to all those who took time to write positive things about yaz. i did a lot of research before taking the pill and frankly, it scared me. so many complaints and horror stories. the most important things to remember is that we all react to substances/hormones in different ways. i'm 35 and haven't taken the pill since i was 20. i am on my 4th pack of yaz and am very pleased. i had a little spotting in the first two months and stomach discomfort, especially when i forget a pill. aside from that, i've lost weight and stay slim even when not active, my breasts have gone up a full size which i love. my sex drive is fine, if not greater, no change in moods. good luck to all."	-10
79674	"i have diabetes type 1 with insulin resistance. works well. i use 200u/day, 100 am, 100 pm. it can burn quite a bit when injected, this is because lantus is fairly acidic with a ph of around 4. when the low ph hits the higher ph of the body, it forms microscopic crystals that are absorbed slowly. this precipitating action that causes the burn as well as makes lantus a long-acting insulin. it helps me to inject the 100 units in 2-3 sites so less goes in per site. also be sure to leave the needle in for 15-30 seconds to avoid leakage. i'm a chemist by trade."	-10
206031	this has a been a wonder drug for me. i have been taking it along with a low dose of wellbutrin for 3 weeks and i don't think i have ever felt better in my life. i noticed an improvement within a few days. no problems sleeping.	-10
108681	"the only good thing about nexplanon is not getting pregnant or having to take a pill. i&rsquo;ve had this implant for about 2 and a half years and i&rsquo;m on my period all the time. i&rsquo;ll bleed for a week, stop for a couple days, and then start again for another week. my periods are usually normal to light- but i&rsquo;m bleeding 50% of my days some months. and often times it looks old and brown. my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; month is a 7 day period. being on my period so much also messes with my vaginal ph. i&rsquo;m getting it removed this week and i&rsquo;m so ready. and so is my husband."	-10
194119	"was diagnosed july 2012, went on meds march 2013, vl 57,000, cd4 502. after 2 months became undetectable, now 5 months later i am undetectable and cd4 is up to 950. my body feels better, and i have had much more energy. only side effects are occasional diarrhea, although i am not sure if that is from the medication. only hassle is the food requirement, but it is a small inconvenience considering this medicine is saving my life."	-10
113593	"i was first prescribed fioricet for hormonal headaches during my pregnancy. it was so effective and helped ease the pain. it did make me drowsy. i still use it for chronic headaches as-needed. the only thing i wish for is that it would work a little more quickly. it takes 45min-1hr for my headaches to ease off. great help all-around, though!"	-10
111654	i was scared to take cipro. i really freak out when i have to take medication. but i did with the support of friends and it works great for urinary tract infections with the first dose. i do have heartburn and gas but i'm still taking it and i will add a zantac and gas x tomorrow.	-10
192301	"within the first 3-5 months of taking this pill, my skin had got 10x worse! my face was constantly dry (no moisturizer would make it any better), my face was also red and blotchy and very sensitive, followed by cystic acne! i didn't know whether to give up or carry on at this point, but it couldn't get any worse than it already was, so i carried on. eventually, after the 5th month of taking this pill, my skin had cleared up a lot! i was so relieved. it's now my 9th month of being on yasmin and my skin is in great condition, i get the odd pimple here and there, but sudocrem does the job. my acne has completely cleared up and i feel comfortable enough not to wear foundation. don't give up taking this pill, just give it time!"	-10
171634	"i just started this medicine a matter of days ago. i am so happy to read all of these reviews. it gives me hope. i have been suffering from depression since i was 16. i am now 24. after meeting the love of my life. he took on me and my two girls from a previous relationship. he is everything i could as for. but i still was not happy. i sit around and eat. i have gained so much weight. all from my depression. i have such high hopes that after trying, paxil, prozac and a couple others..that this will work for me. and give me my life back. my girls nor my boyfriend deserve the person i have became. thank you everyone for sharing."	-10
37572	i am a 32 year old. i have been on vyvanse for about 2 weeks now and i love it. i have never been diagnosed with add and about 2 months ago i was given straterra first. i hated that. my doctor switched me to 30mg vyvanse and the first day i noticed a difference. it lasted me about 10-12 hrs. my appetite went down a little but nothing to bad. other than that there are no other side effects for me. i would definitely recommend vyvanse.	-10
10911	"in the beginning this contraceptive made me nauseated every single day, which was irritating. i did spot more than normal in the first month or two, however i am now 18 months in and like it very much. i don't have nearly as many crazy mood swings on this pill as i have on others and it seems to be a very effective contraceptive (even if i forget to take it and have to play catch-up every once in a while). however, since i've been on it i have experienced yeast infections and urinary tract infections much more often than usual but i'm unsure if that is the pill or change in sexual habits. all in all, not pregnant, so thumbs up."	-10
14539	"i had been taking some opiate pain killers for the last five years, due to a low back injury and one unsuccessful surgery. i was on approximately 90 mg of morphine and 60 mg of oxycodone per day until i decided to try suboxone to quit. it was about 2 months ago when i started and the doctor put me on a 6-week taper. it worked very well. i didn't have any opiate withdrawal symptoms. i think this is a very good drug. i had no side effects that i could tell."	-10
62807	my md put me on cozaar for my hypertension and rapid pulse. i also take verapamil. i have a condition called marfan's syndrome and doctor hopes this medicine will help prevent any further dilation of my aorta. i had to go off the hydrochlorothiazide and now have a lot of edema in my legs to above my knees so started on lasix today also. but it's worth using in order to protect my blood vessels.	-10
173362	by far the most effective medication i have tried (out of at least a dozen) for treating my severe social anxiety and panic attacts. virtually all symptoms were relieved.	-10
164229	"i administered these drops twice a day for 2 days. i experienced the stinging and blurriness and metal taste in mouth, but that went away after about 20 min. on the third day, it left my right eye so so blurred. again, blurriness is a side effect, but it did not go away. i am on day 4 that i can't see out of my right eye. it's extremely blurry, and scary seeing as i've had both my eyes for all my life. the doctor said it's an allergic reaction, and gave me artificial tears to &quot;flush out&quot; the xiidra. basically it's a waiting game on my vision to come back. i will be in and out of my doctor's office until i get some improvement. i guess just beware and see if there's anything milder to try first."	-10
157583	i've had bronchitis for several weeks now and this medicine made such a difference since i took it today. i am so grateful someone came up with this medicine. so far very pleased with the product.	-10
105868	"my daughter is 11 years old and she has been on 10mg of strattera for 28 days and has just jumped to 18mg. my concerns are the side effects. skin rash, headaches and severe stomach cramps since going onto the higher dosage. do i persist or take her off? doctor wants me to persist but i am worried i am doing more harm. she battles to fall asleep taking pill at 6pm and in bed at 8:15pm. she cried every morning because she is tired. should i be taking it in the morning?"	-10
206956	"i am 18 years old and i started this seasonal birth control a 3 months ago. i have had on and off bleeding and major cramps. one day at school, i was starting to see double and i was feeling extremely dizzy. 15 minutes later, my mother picked me up and i started to have numbness in my arms and started to loose my speech. i went to the hospital and got brain scans and the tested my whole body. but everything ended up normal. the doctor said it was rare for someone at my age to get a tia but it was possible but in my case it was minor. i have had tremendous weight gain and more acne. i tried to stick with it at first because i said it has to be at least 3 months. i have immediately stopped taking it and my symptoms are all gone."	-10

163292	"i wanted to tell everyone that i was diagnosed with migraines about 12 years ago, and i was prescribed midrin / duradrin / epidrin ever since. i can tell you, that it is the most effective migraine medication that i have personally taken. my migraines have been so vicious over the last 12 years that i have tried everything over-the-counter and prescription, trying to prevent them in the first place. i guess at this point in my life so far, nothing we have tried has really had any true success. either the medicines i was taking to prevent them in the first place caused more side effects than what i could tolerate. i take 2 caps and feel relief usually within 30 minutes and side effects are minimal."	-10
72378	i have lower back pain and this medicine helps just a little. it does make me nod out a little right after taking. i was using vicoden before and it worked much better for the pain and didn't make me feel as strange as tramadol did but the doctor doesn't want to give me vicoden even though i have 2 fractured discs and a tear in my vertebrae.	-10
172121	i really enjoy taking this when i'm hurting and all i want is to go to bed. works like a charm for me.	-10
107621	"i have had implanon exactly 2 yrs. i loved this birth control for the 1st yr and a half. i had absolutely no period or weight gain. it was an easy and effective birth control. however last august i started having my cycle again. the bleeding was the heaviest it's ever been, very clotty, and unexpected. often i would have bleeding every other week. the length of the period is long, and extremely heavy with cramping! my mood has drastically changed since restarted my cycle. i have depressed feelings and often don't feel like getting out of bed. after starting my cycle back, i experienced weight gain. went to the gyno yesterday and since starting back in august i've gained 30 lbs. no change in my diet and i'm only 21. i'm getting this birth control out!"	-10
221743	"after finally getting around to reading about the possible side effects, i now know why i am having a major acne breakout, also nausea and very loose stools. i don't know what else i can do, but this medicine is not for me."	-10

201510	"i was on zoloft for about 7 years. worked great at first, but eventually had to come off it due to horrible side effects. if i missed a dose, i would have debilitating brain zaps. then, i started the brain zaps randomly through the day regardless of missing a dose or not. this medicine killed my libido."	-10
62087	"i have had anxiety for over ten years. 2 years ago i started having severe panic attacks and anxiety. i tried luvox, prozac, and now i am taking celexa. the first did not do much for me and the prozac made me feel like i was out of my body and gave me really bad side effects. celexa is amazing i am taking 20mg 2x daily. highly recommend!"	-10
66956	the reason i gave it an eight is not that it does a thing for my anxiety due too an mva. i gave it an eight because i take two 25mg at night which helps me sleep.	-10
200911	"i had three cardioversions. one last 6 years. another lasted 1 year and the third one lasted only a week. so, i headed to a hospital in nashville to explore my options. the new cardiologist suggested a 4th cardioversion, but follow up with tikosyn. i was afraid of side effects, however i continued on with the plan. after 17 days, i went back into afib. i decided to stop using caffeine to see if it helped. within 48 hours of eliminating coffee, i was back in rhythm and have been so since. i have no side affects and my exercise routine has dramatically improved. very happy with the results so far."	-10
97598	"had the series of injections years ago. didn't help at all. ended up with knee replacement. now other knee is going and with insurance, injection of synviscone costs over $130 (co-pay) + $30 co-pay for visit. i'm not having it done unless i get a guarantee that it will work. rip-off for the cost and a rip-off that insurance doesn't provide better coverage."	-10
163978	"this is the 2nd time using this cream....more for a pre-cancerous treatment. i used it only on my nose 8 years ago. i am 10 days in on using carac cream for my whole face. i thought there would be only a few areas but i have a lot of sun damage all over my face. nothing on my nose (already treated), forehead less because i had bangs most of my life. during the day i use powder foundation to cover most of the dark red blotches so i can look normal. at night i take nyquil to sleep. so far i can tolerate it all."	-10
144360	"i am just past my 2 year mark with nexplannon and i have mixed feelings about it. after i got it i bled for 2 weeks straight and then it went away. i gained about 15-20 pounds on and off the whole time and the one side effect i get the most is numbness. specifically numbness in my left knee and my right wrist. it's always in those places and never anywhere else. on the plus side, i'm not pregnant so it's doing its job. i love not having to remember pills!"	-10
205710	i am a 67 year old female and i have suffered from fibromyalgia for approximately 35 years. with that being said i have also suffered from depression over the years and have taken prozac and zoloft with no effect. for the past 3 months i have been suffering from anxiety and depression and have been extremely nauseated and have lost 16 pounds. i was on venlafaxine for 2-1/2 weeks with no results and have now been on pristiq for 9 days and instantly felt 100% better. i have my appetite back and have much more energy. i actually feel like living again. i hope my health continues to be better on the medication.	-10
18052	i have been using nuvaring for about 4 months and i love it. i was a little scared to get on birth control because everyone just says negative things. i have not noticed any emotional differences. no mood swings or depression. the only side effects i have noticed are the first few days after i put a ring in i experience loss of appetite and some bloating. overall i am very pleased. my boyfriend never feels it and it has never fallen out during sex. i will continue to use nuvaring.	-10

172981	"very effective at treating social anxiety (while also receiving therapy), keeps you in a more balanced state than with other benzo's, minimal side effects. i was started on 0.5mg 3 times a day but after 3 years i'm down to 0.25mg once a day. i have seen many patients started on too high a dose, i think 0.25mg twice a day is sufficient for most cases and be aware that once you start taking them you will find it hard to stop and will have to wean yourself off them gradually as is the case with most medicines."	-10
217500	"evekeo made me feel like i had the flu. i felt like i had stayed up until 5am drinking tequila. i had had no alcohol at all. my muscles ached, i was exhausted, i felt like i was going to puke, and i could barely move. i went back to vyvanse after 2 days. it ends too early for me, but doesn't make me miserable."	-10

162778	"by far the worst drug ever made. this drug is a synthetic which is why no wonder it does not work. i've been sick for 9 days but been on this for 7 days taking it twice a day religiously. went into the urgent care bc my ear was hurting for the 1st time in my life, my throat was swollen &amp; hurts so much to even barely even swallow my own spit, miragraine, dizzy, coughing, running nose, &amp; my body so weak i had trouble walking. after 7 days being on it's not working. caused my other ear after 2 days to hurt. both ears are so muffed i can't hear a thing. now have to take the z-pack i normally take when i'm sick that she called in. fyi when u tell a doctor what works for u do not settle for what they think u should take. know ur body!!"	-10
113445	"a friend recommended so i thought i would give it a try. she never mentioned severe pain. just that your stomach hurts a bit because that means it's working. i took 3 pills around 9:30 pm and at 11:30 pm the severe cramping began. i also became extremely nauseous. i was doubled over in pain, it was so painful i had no idea what to do with myself. on a scale from 1-10 the cramping was a 12! it did do it's job but the severe pain is not worth it at all."	-10
28572	"i started taking lexapro for anxiety associated with over analyzing everything.. parents separating.. and getting engaged. the side effects the first couple of weeks included nausea, dizziness, headaches and wide awake feeling at night. the pros: took away the thoughts running through my mind.. blushing.. helped even out all of my emotions. the cons: i stopped lexapro in december before i wanted to get pregnant and 1 week later i had a massive migraine (never had one) and lost my ability to speak.. see.. it was awful.. rushed to the er thinking i had a stroke.. everything came back fine. just remember if you plan on getting off before pregnancy.. give yourself a good few mths. the withdrawls are a nightmare!!! dizziness, nausea.,headaches"	-10
71548	"i usually don't read reviews on medication because i want to give the drug an unbiased try. after 5 weeks on vraylart the lowest dose, here are my adverse reactions: insomnia, panic, paranoia, fear, mania, easily startled, itching, rash, decreased vision, dry cough, gerd, upset stomach, increased urination, loose stool. the insomnia started immediately. i would sleep a couple of hours and then be wide awake. the drug wore me out because of all the resulting side effects. i had no side effects on seroquel and, after discontinuing the vraylar, i am relieved to be back on it."	-10

33557	i gained 25 lbs in the 2 months i was on this pill. i also had no sex drive at all. my hubby is not liking that at all. my breast did go up and for me already being a full d was not good. i will be switching back to the ring! i hope the weight comes off fast!	-10

116040	"vimpat has been awesome at controlling my seizures. i was having multiple partial seizures a day and nocturnal grand mals every few months. however, i haven't had a seizure since i started taking vimpat 6 years ago. i have experienced some of the same side effects others have mentioned; the dizziness/shaking, the sleepiness, the loss of my words/stuttering. i haven't experienced anything substantial with my hair or moods though, at least nothing that i can attribute to vimpat alone. so all in all, it has worked well for me and the benefits outweigh the negative side effects."	-10
84559	"i've been taking trinessa for the past 14 months now. it's the first oral birth control i've ever been on, so at first i thought it was normal. i knew when my period was coming, it kept me from getting pregnant, and it cleared up my face. however, ever since i've been taking it, my anxiety has reached a whole new level. not to mention, i have depression for the first time in my life. i have had suicidal thoughts, i've felt my self esteem go down, and i've felt irritable towards nearly everyone in my life. it has affected a lot of my close relationships, such as my boyfriend who is constantly having to put up my depression and anxiety attacks. i would consider another pill if you have these issues."	-10
168606	"was taking effexor with good results but had to change meds due to cost. switched to viibryd due to availability from my services provider at no cost. while maybe not quite as effective as the effexor, i have been on the viibryd for several years with good results and no side effects that i've had with other anti-depressants. it has improved my quality of life very much. no depressive periods even while handling some difficult times. it's been a godsend for me."	-10

143093	"this implant has been a complete blessing. for years i was on birth control to regulate my period and mood swings, but since i'm deployed on a ship for most of the year, i had to pay out of pocket for my pills because my insurance only covered 3 month &quot;vacation&quot; packs. this became expensive. i've been on the implant for 3 months now and have been ecstatic with the results. the first two weeks i experienced a light period (not thrilled about it, but was optimistic). the second month i received slight spotting during my time of month, but this month there was nothing! my sex drive (which was relatively high before) has been crazy high, which my fianc&eacute;e loves, and i don't mind either haha. no weight gain or mood swings. completely satisfied!"	-10
49149	"started taking this pill 3 months ago. worked fine the first month. no spotting or anything, now i'm on month 3 and i have been on a heavy flow peorid for 3 weeks. acne is acting out. and massive weight gain. used to weigh 120 and now i weigh 134. do not recommend this drug"	-10
41588	"i used this medication for 3 days for motor tics (blinking and head jerking) the first day i took half a tablet in the morning and half a tablet at night. the side effects were horrible. insomnia - feeling weak and lethargic - limbs would go numb especially when i'm trying to sleep - dry mouth - depressed - falling asleep/ dozing off at work and while driving (very dangerous) day 2 and 3 i just took half a tablet at night and the side effects in the day weren't as bad but still there. the effects at night were just as bad if not worse i was only getting 3 good hours of sleep - the rest is praying to sleep. but in saying that, the tics did ease a little bit. i have now stopped the meds today. will not take it again."	-10
182338	"i have had the iud for almost 2 years now. the first year was great. last month i noticed i'm more moody have bad acne. i still have not lost my baby weight. i actually weigh more. i feel as if i'm pregnant. have migraines, hip and abdominal pain, heartburn. i have taken test but all come out negative. the other girls who have had the same side effects say that urine test will not read you need a blood test or ultra sound. i am making my appointment and having this removed."	-10
26178	"terrible. when i skipped the placebos and began my 2nd pack, and my forehead exploded in acne within the first 3 days, and several painful cysts formed. i've been getting way more hormonal cysts since i first began sprintec, one even on my upper lip and underneath my brow but this was the last straw. six cysts are now on my chin that i had to get injected today, because i couldn't even open my mouth to eat or smile. fun, right? i also have 3 nasty pustules around my mouth. please, put the sprintec down and back away slowly before you get hurt!"	-10
33153	"i've been on seasonique for about a year now. overall it's great, while the birth control is pretty pricey in my area (it's about 90 dollars a month where i live) but it's worth it. i've had no problems with this pill except the occasional spotting. it actually cleared my skin while i do have an occasional spot. i don't get headaches, backaches or many other side effects. i guess the pill is different for everyone but for me this works like a charm! it's great only having my period once every three months."	-10
120507	"i was perfectly happy on invokana, then my insurance stopped covering it and my dr put me on farxiga to try. oh my gosh, thought i would die, it did not work on me at all. it gave me a yeast infection the first day, sugar stayed high for hours after meals, could barely pee, it made my heart race, and i felt horrible, horrible, horrible. so now i have to try jardiance, i cant imagine it being worse than farxiga, i sure hope i am able to pee with this medication."	-10
46626	"i have been on gleevec now for 6 months and in that time i have had maybe 5 well days, the other days have been filled with vomiting, nausea, body aches &amp; pains, migraines, lethargy, insane amounts of facial swelling and my weight is just up &amp; down like a yoyo, varying from 82kilos down to 75. i now realize that when i said this wasn't the right medication for me 5 months ago i was right. today my hematologist told me that my philadelphia gene is unacceptably high, so now i am going to try something else. i am delighted to hear that others are doing so well on it but it certainly wasn't for me"	-10
155863	"i am taking the last dose of this drug (0.2g x 2 tablets three times a day) for 4 days. the cyst on the upper gum is less sensitive and smaller. however, it has not gone away yet. this is the reason, i may take another course. i have no side effects except mild dry mouth. this is the reason i rated this drug 8/10."	-10

108948	"i have been on nexplanon for the past two years. when i first got the implant, everything was going great until a month into it. my mood changed drastically due to the hormones and i wanted it out as soon as possible. i was told to wait a few months to get used to it so i abided by this. 4-6 months in, i started getting horrible acne, and i am now on two different prescriptions to (hopefully) get rid of it. the acne won't go away and my dermatologist said it won't until i get the implant taken out. fast forward to today, i have been continuously bleeding for three weeks, going on four, (have never bled on nexplanon before) and can't take it any longer. nexplanon was great, up until now and the other side effects."	-10
129389	constant bleeding for the entire 9 weeks i had it in. range from moderate to light. only 4-5 days blood free and not consecutive. think it is stopping one day only to start the next. hair loss 1 month in and strange headaches. also stuffy nose. only one star due to painless insertion. getting it pulled next week. cannot wait to be normal again. rather have 1 week of bleeding vs. constant light bleeding.	-10

(if prilosec couldn't cure you, you must be really bad) then prilosec must be the best otc out there. so i took the 21 day cycle. i was so uncomfortable that i took 2 the first day. i don't recommend that, but i did. after 3 days i say a small improvement. after 1 week i was sure it was working. 21 days later completly cured"	-10

182907	"my husband took this drug for 1 month. he started losing his hair and that was a deal-breaker for him. not enough of a trial to know effectiveness of the drug- but this bad rating was given because of the withdrawals. brain zaps, nightmares, anger, vomiting and nausea. we started reading up online concerning the dependency called &quot;cymbalta discontinuation syndrome&quot; ...um wtf?? please look it up- people are staying on the drug only because the withdrawal symptoms are so bad and can last longer than the time you were taking the drug. my husband could be suffering for a year- we are newlyweds! please do not start this drug if you haven't already!!!"	-10
105842	"i read all these reviews and i still took it. i told my doctor about the reviews and my concerns and she pushed me to try it so i did. progressively i could not leave my house. i was so tired. i could only have the strength to shower once every 9 days. i felt myself becoming more and more tired and for some reason i just stayed with it- i gradually increased the dosage and ate it with food, all the tips everyone's said i've done because i wanted it so badly to work. but it has made me sick and i'm not sure if i've recovered even now, a month after stopping. the final straw was me starging to feel worse i had been in years. please do not be like me. i saw the reviews and i did not listen."	-10
82440	i was worried this would not work for me since i was not really that overweight (6'2-206). i began working out 5 times a week and was losing weight but only a very small amount and i was hitting a wall. once i began using victoza and continuing my workout routine the weight just started shedding right off. this was everything i always dreamed of. you will lose some weight just by taking this but if you include it with working out wow! also it does curve your appetite but i have noticed you can eat healthier things without feeling ill. it seems that high sugar and fats are the ones that i get turned off too which is just an added bonus. 1 month into it and i am now 186lbs so i have lost 20 pounds and feel and look great!	-10
50111	"symptoms of my small fiber are burning, prickling and deep pain in extremities. gabapentin felt like it worked for the first few days. but then needed to be upped to the next dose after about 5 days. then the cycle continued. some relief, then needed to be upped again. in my case i found my body built up a tolerance too quickly. was up to 3000mg and experience no relief at all. its very hit or miss when it comes to small fiber neuropathy."	-10
93766	i fractured and hemorrhaged my neck in 2001 at the age of 12. i've been on and off all kinds of narcotics and was recently introduced to avinza. this stuff is awesome! even at the low 30mg dose i feel much better but i still keep my norco around for break through pain when needed. i recommend this medicine to anyone dealing with chronic pain.	-10

19827	could not function or hold up my own weight. lyrica gave me my life back weeks after starting it. i had dealt with pain for over 10 years. i'm 39 and had weight gain but a small amount of a prescribed fluid pill took off pounds quickly.	-10
141964	i started taking lexapro going on 3 weeks ago and i think it's great. the side effects that i suffered in the very beginning were headaches but they are all pretty much gone. i also did not put on any additional weight. i actually lost about 4 pounds. it seems to suppress my appetite. i highly recommend it.	-10
106087	"diagnosed with depression and anxiety, found symptoms lessened with wellbutrin xr. year later diagnosed with adult adhd, all add with little hd. started strattera and felt a slight improvement in focus, but also felt distant and flat. stopped strattera due to severe constipation. tried adderall, little effect on focus and concentration, and turned into a chatty cathy. i did sleep better than ever though. next, ritalin with close to the same effects, but without the great sleep. back to strattera to give it another shot, constipation lessened, but still feel that it is not helping with the add. considered adding adderall or ritalin in with, but doctor now recommending psych evaluation to look deeper. scary, but necessary."	-10
127275	i have tried this medication without success. when my cravings became too difficult i would stop taking the medication and plan my drinking for 4 to 5 days later which sometimes wasn't enough time to get the medicines out of my system and became very ill. my recommendation is if you are going to use this medication and you don't trust yourself have someone else administer the pills to you and keep you accountable. congratulations to those who have found success on this. i'm trying campral next.	-10
136530	"i went to the store looking for visine a, which works perfectly. they didn't have it. but they had visine totality so i got it, since i prefer visine to the others and still do...but this stuff was potent. a tingling sensation is okay and sometimes expected. but these things burn."	-10
150511	"saturday morning i woke up to use the bathroom and there was a lot of blood in my urine along with a bad smell &amp; very cloudy. i've never had a uti before , i looked up the symptoms and figured that that's what i had. i took some cranberry pills saturday after noon &amp; it helped so much. i wanted to go to the doctor just to make sure everything was okay and on monday she gave me these pills. i took my first one around 11pm , i woke up at 3am sweating, head pounding, shakes &amp; felt the need to throw up. i threw up at lease 4 times and after i couldn't sleep at all. these suck . whatever you do don't take them! it's the tuesday and i still feel horrible all from just one pill!!!!! i wish i never took these"	-10
147707	"i've been taking this birth control for about 7 months now. when i first started i noticed that my sex drive dropped a lot. every now and then i get emotional/angry over little things. this pill didn't make me gain/lose weight and it cleared my skin up but every now and then i'd get a pimple before my period. the periods lasted 4-5days no change in that. but the most upsetting thing was my hair got thinner! maybe to others it's probably not a big deal but if you love your hair as much as i do, it's a problem. believe me i never wanna be bald. after i finish my current pack i'm getting off this pill for good."	-10
226775	"i have been on implanon for almost three years now and will probably get it again when the time is due. when i first started my periods became spotty and then went away all together. it's fantastic. no mood swings, so weight gain, and no acne either. i was on the depo shot before this and that was complete opposite. i've had no issues with implanon and would definitely recommend it."	-10
60577	i have struggled with acne for so long i started getting it in the 6th grade i got cystic acne in 8th grade and it was horrible because i went to a kindergarten through 8th grade school every day a little kid would say something about it like &quot;oh my god what happened to your face&quot; &quot;ew what's on your face&quot; i was so embarrassed and i had tried almost every acne medication out there. i never wanted to try accutane because i was scared of all the side effects but it was worth it. i'm a sophomore in high school now and my skin is completely clear and the only side effect i noticed were that my lips got badly dried out but it wasn't a huge problem.	-10
30959	"this is the worst itch and pain i have experienced. i should have read these reviews before i used this product. i used the one day to try to end this quickly. it has made the symptoms much much worse, i couldn't sleep at night literally being tortured. i feel so miserable and just want to cry. how do i get this out of me?"	-10
30250	this medication helps me to function and feel sane!	-10
171216	i'm in my 70's and found that my erections would come and go during sex. i had previously tried viagra and had a migraine the next day. my experience has varied... sometimes great and sometimes not as good. there is a correlation between the nasal stuffiness and the erection quality. no gain without the pain! i'm going to try taking it a bit sooner and see if that makes it more reliable.	-10
93537	"my doctor prescribes morphine sulfate ir 15, to me for chronic pain. i get a really bad pain in my abdomen immediately after i take a dose, happens every time. does anybody have this problem? the only thing i like about taking morphine, is that i don't get groggy from it, but, it doesn't seem to &quot;kill&quot; my pain completely. my doctor used to prescribe me oxycodone 40 mg, i couldn't stand the way that it made me feel, i'd get drowsy and feel like i was on heroin or something and it didn't take away my pain."	-10
171024	"i've only been on seroquel xr for 5 days, so it's hard to tell long term side effects. it definitely makes me calmer and allows me to handle difficult or stressful situations more appropriately (not crying at the drop of a hat or feeling extreme anxiety). i am only on 50 mg at bedtime, but i'm not completely 100% so hoping to increase that dose a bit when i see my doc next. i do get headaches and have lost my appetite (still haven't lost any weight though). i am hoping for the best!"	-10
61332	i've been on premarin for over 20years. when i started i had side effects of bloating and constipation. over time those resolved. i don't know why i'm still having hot flashes 20+ yrs after menopause. now i take.625 every other day due to the expense. that works. if i try to cut back to every third day the hot flashes return in a short time.	-10

200979	i was on zoloft for a few years as i have generalized anxiety disorder. i am also somewhat add and suffer from chronic insomnia but no depression. it helped but i got a new doctor and we decided to try wellbutrin and vyvance respectively to treat the add. wellbutrin actually made me depressed and the vyvance did wonders for the add but horrible for anxiety. e we then tried effexor. not the one. i went back begging for my zoloft and a clonazepam at night. by far the best drug for me. it does take a couple of weeks before it calms me down enough to sleep. being back on it feels like coming home again!	-10
66578	i try to avoid going on these forums because they always give me anxiety about the new medication i am trying out. i have let this forum make me think that side affects were happening to me that really weren't in the past. seroquel is amazing. i have bi polar and seroquel was not out when i was first diagnosed. i started on it may of 2016 and i have had to increase my dose 100mg since then and it has changed my life. seroquel has given me the ability to start to live my life more the way i want to live it. i wanted to post that here to not discourage someone who is starting out on it. my psychiatrist heard about this from one of the top bi polar doctors in the world speak at harvard. this drug is wonderful and so helpful.	-10
173776	"i have tried many treatments for my eczema and this, and its generic form, have been the best. i get dry skin, redness, and cracking between my fingers, at the wrist and sometimes on the lower arm. one treatment at night and by morning the redness is gone, irritation gone, and after the 2nd day of treatment, no signs or symptoms of the eczema."	-10
65699	i have to say this medication changed my life! i kept having these chronic migraines with symptoms of a stroke. no feeling in my limbs cant see cant hear throwing up passing out and they were relentless and left me in the er 24/7. i passed out on someone on a bus and woke up unable to speak my name in an ambulence. i began taking this med and the original effect was low blood pressure tired a lot and it made me quit taking it. i noticed my symptoms return shortly after quitting on it. so i tried taking one whole 20mg tablet during an attack and i couldnt believe it my vision returned and the attack ended early. i have taken it 4-5 times daily ever since and it saved my life. haven't had a single attack in years!	-10
88164	"i took clindamycin for two days before my extraction of my wisdom tooth and then two days after, i had some heart burn feeling and i was taking it with food. i'm tired of taking antibiotics and have to deal with the aftermath of flora being screwed up in my system for weeks. so, i decided to stop taking it. i went to my md and they gave me something equally strong and effective, but gentle on the digest system."	-10
220557	"in all honesty, this pill is the answer. i love everything about it. i have been on it for three months now and i have had no symptoms what-so-ever. there has been no weight gain, and it has only slightly changed the size of my breasts. i have had no mood swings or nausea. in the three months i have been on it, i take it every morning at 6, and it works great. the package that it comes in is perfect, it is small, easy to read, and comes with a tiny discrete black cloth pocket to hold the pack in. perfect to throw in your purse if you are spending the night somewhere else. as well i have had no period, which was scary in the beginning, but my doctor assured me everything was fine and normal. i highly recommend this pill."	-10
44207	"i am 25 years old and have been on tri-sprintec for seven years. recently i have gone off of it as i am just now experiencing side effects. mood swings, bloating, and weight gain. 55 lbs in the last two years..not an exaggeration! it worked for a while so i would recommend people to try it. realize your body changes and sometimes birth control that worked before doesn't work anymore."	-10
80128	it has done nothing for my cough from pneumonia.	-10
200762	after 5 weeks of using chantix i had to stop taking the medication. i felt extremely unstable and not myself. after 4 days off the medication i am still not smoking (which is why i still gave this medicine a 3 rating). i hope things will go back to normal. i have started to feel less &quot;fuzzy&quot; and uncomfortable. good luck to anyone who is trying. i really hope that the time without cigarettes has allowed me to break my habits so i can lead a healthier life.	-10
162643	"i never had yeast infections before and then all of a sudden one day, i began having chronic ones, repeatedly. it was torture and the worst part was that nothing worked to cure them...until i switched doctors and he prescribed this. he instructed me to use it 7 nights straight and like magic, i've been good since. approximately 2 months infection free, after 5 months of headache after headache. this stuff works!"	-10
132823	"looking over these reviews, it's such a relief to know that i am not alone in dealing with the horrible, embarrassing and painful cystic acne this has caused me. until starting, my (then) clear, flawless skin was the thing i liked best about myself. however, within a month, this had truly ruined my skin forever. excessive and deep cystic acne that did not respond to any dermatologist treatments and sent me into a spiral of low self-esteem. gyno insisted i stick with it for 6 months to see if it evened out. it did not! instead, what i've been left with is unresponsive acne for the past two years (yes...1.5 years after i stopped taking this) because of this horrible pill. also, did not work properly and gave me 2 periods/month :) stay away!"	-10

133791	"bactrim cured my prostatitis within two weeks, however i had to stop taking it earlier than prescribed because i discovered i was allergic. i noticed flu-like symptoms, including chills, fever, and horrible muscle aches. on top of that, i developed a head to toe rash that itched like crazy. imagine being sore and itchy at the same time. luckily, all of this subsided within a few days of quitting bactrim. since the antibiotic kills bacteria everywhere, i noticed i had flawless skin for about a week. but that didn't last. the bacteria came back with a vengeance and i developed the worst acne of my life. i'm now taking doxycycline and using expensive creams to combat this. it's been two months since i stopped bactrim and i am still breaking out!"	-10
64183	zoloft actually changed my life. it's helped me cope with every day situations in an non reactive way. my thoughts have calmed down and my anxiety is minimal. i've actually lost 15 lbs on zoloft. i started on 50mg and now i'm up to 200mg per day. i've been on it for about a year now and i like that it doesn't numb everything or make me super emotional or tired. i'm very well balanced. i just wish i could sleep better.	-10
74011	"i am in my second pack of loestrin and its awful. i had just ended my period when i first started taking it, then i started it again after my first week of pills. i have currently been on my period now for 4 and a half weeks. not only that, but i have gained 5 pounds since i've started. i'm an extremely active person, but this pill has made me so tired and hungry all the time. i've had the craziest dreams and it just hasn't been a good experience at all. i just can't get over the fact that i've been on my period this whole time and that i've gained weight (and its noticeable)."	-10
51110	"oh man . i would recommend people to just practice safe sex ! this medication works but the price you may have to take for not practicing safe sex with it is hell ! stomach pain and nausea out this world , and it seems like the side effects will last forever . mine lasted for about 2 hours and i still feel bad but once you take the medication and get through the side effects , it's over ! just remember no glove , no love lol"	-10

43893	"i bought this laxative after seeing the commercial on tv - i thought it would be effective with few side effects. it is a complete waste of money. after 3 days i am extremely uncomfortable. i have constant abdominal cramps and pressure, terrible gas and only managed to pass a small bowel movement. i have even increased the dosing to twice a day to try and get relief but to no avail. i will not use this laxative again."	-10
198835	"i took the shot for about a year but had to come off of it due to medical problems. while on the shot i bled very little if at all. after i came off of it, it's been 6 months and there hasn't been a day where i've stopped bleeding heavily. it's been a 24/7 period, everyday, since i came off of the shot. it also caused massive weight loss for me, nausea, and drowsiness. if you're thinking about taking it, there is no positive reason to, it doesn't keep you from becoming pregnant and although it gets rid of your period while you're on it, once you come off of the shot your period will not stop for months."	-10
70040	"i have had migraines for 30 years. in the last year and a half they went from 15 day/month to practically every day. triptans do not work as an abortive for me. propananol is the only preventative thus far that has worked - but it stopped working after 4 weeks. my neurologist prescribed dhe in the injectible form. i do not like the little glass vials the dhe comes in, breaking them open, and using the syringe. that said, almost every time i use it, it breaks the migraine. unfortunately, it does not always last more than 4-6 hours. i can get this at my local cvs (though they don't carry it in stock). i don't notice any side-effects but i generally take a nap afterward to let it do it's thing."	-10

87852	"due to cellulitis on my ankle, i was given clindamycin, and as the pharmacist suggested, i immediately began taking high dosage of probiotics. in spite of the precaution, i developed a full body rash and 3 bouts of c difficile. the cellulitis, was therefore treated with yet another antibiotic. the cellulitis finally healed completely after 2 months, and the c difficile was eventually cleared, and after 6 months the labs results came back negative (meaning i no longer had it). i continue to take probiotics, but a lower dosage, for sheer fright of the cd recurring. i was told that continual bouts of cd would likely eventually require surgical intervention. a very frightening experience."	-10
136344	"i've been dealing with a lot of stress lately and been only getting a couple of hours of sleep a night due to it. this pill helped me get to sleep and stay asleep, it all felt like i was back to normal, not taking anything, just finally being able to sleep, and sleep well. it didn't make me tired, more of just being able to sleep. i felt as if my problems and worries were for later and now was for relaxation and sleep. i've tried a few other things for sleep such as ambien, but none provided the satisfaction of being able to just go to sleep and sleep well with only the best of dreams. instead of having nightmares of random things infused with my trouble and worries i had amazing dreams of the things i loved."	-10
223663	"i have been on this for 3 weeks, and i am not impressed. but since my dermatologist told me to try it for two months (and i've read others' reviews), i am going to stick it out. i didn't have horrible acne to begin with, but i was starting to get bad cystic ones on my checks, especially during my ovulation and menstrual cycle. so my doctor recommended this med. after the first week, things started to get worse! now on week three and i have the worse acne i have had in a long time!! it is pretty embarrassing, especially considering i wasn't too bad before i started this drug. i am hopeful that things will get better, and my face will clear up, and stay clear even during those cycle times. but right now it is awful!"	-10

184507	"i cold turkeyed off xanax after 16 years of 1 mg a day. i had horrible withdrawal symptoms. at 4 months my md (not the dr that suggested i go cold turkey) but the one that helped me through it, put me on atarax, 10 - 25 mg as needed up to 100 mg a day. it really made a difference in my recovery. i take it as i need, or don't take it at all. it helps with the anxiety, nausea, shaking. i have been on it for 9 months now and really recommend people try it."	-10
17002	"it actually works! i have had sleep issues for years-the prescription meds do nothing for me. the klonopin i was taking to help me fall asleep stopped working so i tried unisom sleep tabs and it took about 30-45 mins to kick in but i was able to fall asleep and stay asleep. it's the first time in a long time that i slept through the night. i was groggy when i got up, but a shower and some coffee woke me right up."	-10

144023	"i went on nexplanon after experiencing depression and crying spells while on numerous birth control pills. i was happy that nexplanon is very convenient because you don't need to remember to take it each day like the pills. however, i have a history of cystic acne and went on accutane several years ago. around the second month of being on nexplanon, i was breaking out on my shoulders and neck (which are areas that i haven't broken out in for years). i also had a lot more breakouts on my face. i noticed that my skin was much more oily as well. i would not recommend this to anyone who has struggled with acne in the past or is currently struggling with it."	-10
26569	"after over a year of taking, my skin stays clear and weight had dropped a little (nothing major though, and i'm 20). however, my husband noticed decreased sex drive and dryness, and i have to add pre-menstrual migraines, resistant to over the counter painkillers, which has never happened before. it's probably because of the amount of estrogen in it."	-10
109607	"i got the nexplanon july of 2014 due to my previous iud (mirena) getting lodged into one of my ovaries and needing to get it removed. before that, i had tried all different kinds of birth control pills, ending up either getting sick, forgetting to take them, or too expensive. the first six months were great; periods regular and no noticeable side effects. after six months, though, i began experiencing drastic mood swings and waves of depression. my period disappeared for about a year, and i began gaining weight rapidly. now 2 years in, i have visible acne for the first time and have been bleeding for over 2 weeks with painful cramps. also having insomnia, lower sex drive, and more intense anxiety. i plan on removing it when i can afford to."	-10
163021	"i took actonel for 7 months. i'm 55 yrs young and active! one day each month after taking actonel i had flu-like symptoms for 4 months and then it got better, however i experienced esophagus burning."	-10
114685	"i was very ill on methotrexate for 10 weeks, nauseous,weak,pain in my chest. i was told i would get used to the side effects. after 10 weeks in ended up in er vommiting blood requiring blood transfusions. methotrexate was very dangerous for me and has destroyed my stomach. i found minocin very helpful until i pulled out infected root canal.... instant relief. no pains now."	-10
45488	"where do i begin....wow this medicine has really given me my life back! i truly felt like i was loosing my mind before i started taking this. i am in my late 30's, and for the past couple years i have tried several other medications for my severe mood swings (pms). being a mother of 3, with a husband, and working as a full time critical care nurse, i needed my life back!! my doctor said she had been going back to the &quot;old faithful&quot; prozac for a lot of her patients. and boy am i glad i finally tried this one! i haven't had any of the crazy side effects i was scared of, and i feel calmer, happier, and not so socially awkward. i'm only on 20mg, but i feel wonderful with this."	-10
116151	"for the 1st yr i had implanon, i got my period like crazy on &amp;off for a few consecutive months. the 2nd yr, i never got my period at all. it was great(: but closing in on the 3rd year i began to get my period again. the second implant (nexplanon), i have been getting my periods pretty regularly. once a month, for a few days. i've just finished 2yrs on this one. 1 more to go. cant say much about weight gain bc i havent been eating/exercising properly for the past few yrs &amp;thats my fault. also, acne; ive had my whole life so i cant say its causes my random break outs. &amp;of course, w. mood swings, id say i get a little over emotional right before mother nature hits but hey who doesnt right? anyway,kept me from getting pregnant the last 5yrs"	-10
59679	was on nuvaring twice. long story but i don't remember the first time and it was also a short period of time. the last time i was on it for about a week when my hands started breaking out in a weird rash and i felt odd. my doc thinks i was allergic to something in it so i took it out and my hands went back to normal right away. odd reaction.	-10
157813	best decision i have ever made .. previously i used to sit in my house because i was to ashamed to go out but accutane changed my life for the better.	-10
174970	not really sure this drug is really helping. so neutral for effectiveness. have taken drug now for 4 months. am starting to wean off of it due to all the negative side effects. i would caution anyone thinking of taking this medication.	-10
4517	"i love belviq! i am just starting my 4th week and have lost 13 lbs but more important i have lost a total of 10 1/2 inches from chest, waist and hips. i feel better, i look better and best of all...no side effects!!! belviq has helped me curb all my cravings! i have cut out pop, sugar, fast food and most dairy. when i do eat, i am very satisfied on very little. my daily calorie intake is 1200 or below. now i just need to find time to exercise. oh and one good side effect is that i sleep like a baby!!! and maybe it does make me a little thirsty but that's okay cuz water is so important to weighthe loss. i try to drink at least 80 oz of water a day. did i mention i love belviq? well i really do! looking forward to losing 50 more lbs!"	-10
205650	"i have been on pristiq for a few years now at different dosages: 50mg - positives: loss of appetite, weight loss and feeling great. negatives: your body gets used to the medicine until it seemingly no longer works. the side effects of loss of appetite, sleep patterns etc. do stop after about 3 weeks. 100mg - feel good, appetite normal. negatives: you will feel drowsy to exhausted. again my body seems to get immune to the dosage. 200mg - postive: feel good and normal energy levels. negative: major weight gain, constipation and you feel the cold/hot flushes. these side effects don't wear of with time at this dosage."	-10
171094	"pretty good medication for the condition. my thoughts are more straight and i seem to have less visual and auditory distortions. it is sedating though and takes a little time for your body to adjust to it. i take 100mg in the morning and 400mg at night, seems to work pretty good in combination with effexor for depression, and it's decent for mild anxiety (however if you have major anxiety, it may not be enough on its own)."	-10
185906	"i had great results with pristiq, but since switching to generic over 2 months ago it hasn't been nearly effective. i have increased my dose twice and i feel more depressed than when i started pristiq."	-10
85655	"in my opinion, this pill really has many positive things to it. i've had no moods swings. i've been able to control my weight so much easier on this pill and my periods have been lighter and shorter. the only problem the first week i used it i've been nauseated. other than that great pill."	-10
57964	"i had a traumatic injury to my neck and shoulders about 7 years ago and didn't have proper treatment to repair the injury, so now i have constant moderate-to-severe pain in my neck/shoulder/back. norcos really help a lot, but, as others have said, they don't last very long. i have to take 1.5-2 10/325mg tablets every 4 hours (at the most). worst side effect: constipation. by far. since my back hurts all the time, the thought of going and playing sports is intimidating to say the least, so i don't exercise nearly as much as i should (i've gained 35 pounds since the accident and i'm 28 now). overall this is a great medicine and one i would recommend."	-10
45096	"18y/o with anxiety/ depression i was given medication for the anxiety originally and then the doctor gave me fluoxetine 20mg, this was fine the first week, no side effects. second week, i was living in a constant state of panic, beta blockers weren't helping and i always had chest pains and severe panic attacks. i couldn't stand to be in a classroom full of my peers, they made me feel paranoid about everyone. i absolutely hate these."	-10
123536	"i got skyla inserted two years ago. i still had periods on skyla but they were much heavier and i had awful cramps. skyla also caused me to have terrible acne. it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that i started to have more issues. my periods began lasting more than a week and a half and were only two weeks apart. i&rsquo;ve been suffering from headaches daily, no energy, dizziness, and nausea. i just don&rsquo;t feel like myself. i called my doctor and he seemed to think removing skyla would solve the problems. i went this morning to have it removed (which is pain-free!!!) so hopefully things will get better!"	-10
196814	"i absolutely hated this medication. i have been struggling with panic attacks and major depression since i was younger. i was put on this medication for about a year and my panic attacks were not so often. the downsides of medication is that i felt little to no emotion, and had zero sex drive."	-10
147892	"i really was looking forward and trying this new birthcontrol. the first month was fine with little to no side effects. however about 3 months in, it started to have a negative effect on my mental health. i didn't feel like me and became very sensitive to the smallest problems. as well as it completely messed up my menstrual cycle. would i recommend it? no. never."	-10
29586	"i've been suffering badly with migraines nearly everyday for the past 18 months while sitting my gcse exams, so it made it even more difficult as i couldn't concentrate. i was put on these tablets 2 months ago and they have massively helped, while they have not got rid of the migraines completely, rather than having one every day and not being good for anything at all times i tend to go weeks without one and just suffer with a migraine for 2-3 days which i much prefer as i know that most days i will be fine. i have had most side effects but they are manageable; pins and needles, memory loss, clumsiness, runny nose, sore throat, swollen joints, mixing words, tired all the time, unable to sleep a full night, lack of concentration and more."	-10
68975	"i hopped on the depo august 2012 after having my child on and off untill april 2015 i had no bleeding in the time i was on it, until beginning if august 2015 i started bleeding went to the doctors they made me do s.t.i and s.t.d checks everything came back negative for anything but still bleeding , but then i found out i had to have minor surgery for cervical cancer so doctors assumed that , that could be the cause of the continuos bleeding i've had the surgery done but still bleeding i have no idea why, i've gotta go back to the doctors once again so they can send me for some type of scan to find out why . has anyone else had this problem ?"	-10
18704	i just took three doses of 0.25mg cabergoline but i developed severe headache and even fainted. my doctor suggested to stop medication for about a month.	-10
156480	"my doctor gave me the injection in his office. i take no other meds for my diabetes (type 2). a1c was around 10, triglycerides were 3000, cholesterol was 541. i also have acute pancreatitis, and later read this med was not good for this pre-existing condition. that night after the shot, i became ill, lower back pains, an extreme full feeling in my tummy, nausea, and dizziness. he also prescribed tricore to get my triglycerides down. i have been sloppy with my diet, and i know what i need to do to change my eating. i honestly can say, after reading other reviews, that this drug scares me, and i wont be buying more. 629 drug interactions i read about on another site and me being fatigued and in a fog for three days, i say no more."	-10
210181	"linzess works great for me. if you are going too much when you take it once a day, cut back by taking it every other day and that should help the diarrhea too. if you are still having too much diarrhea, take it every third day. i would be glad i wasn't constipated any more!!!! not going is worse than diarrhea any day. hopes this info helps."	-10
51269	"i have been on zithromax twice for an upper respiratory tract infection and both times i was as sick as a dog. constant runs (comes on fast, nausea, bloating, flatlence, aches, chills; basically feeling like i had a bad flu without the fever. i felt better just having the chest infection :-p use this drug only if milder medications do not work!"	-10
30760	"this is horrible. horrible. horrible. 1st tube wasn't that bad. 2nd tube the hell started. i thought it was the itching cream because i hadn't put any on the 1st time. so 3rd night comes, i didn't put the itching cream on but the pain is literally from hell itself. i get that there is side effects, but the side effects shouldn't be worse than the original problem. i unfortunately bought the 7 day to avoid going to the doctor and i cannot do 4 more nights of this so i'm going to the doctor."	-10
214997	"i have been taking symbyax for 3 weeks. i cannot believe the difference its made in my life. i was always against anti-depressants since all i had tried made me feel worse. i haven't had energy or motivation like this in, i cant remember how long! it is hard to wake up if i take it too late in the evening. i'm afraid of the weight gain but i think it would be worth it. i am only giving it a 9 since it is so expensive and i have no insurance."	-10
26987	"good medicine, it gets rid of your pain without that drowsy sick feeling."	-10
10892	i've been taking mononessa for 10 months and i need help. my periods been crazy i start then stop in two days. then in 3 weeks i start again ugh. am i the only one out there that it happens to?	-10
144735	"had it in for 3 weeks.. not sure if i have had any side effects. i've been a super horrible to my husband the past week. which isn't really me, and i've cried twice this week like it was the end of days.. which is unlike me. though i'm also a new mom to a 6 week old.. don't know if its stress or this.. also, just started my period (great) its heavy! everyone's reviews on here are freaking me out a bit. i definitely don't want to gain weight especially while still on the process of loosing the 35lbs i gained while pregnant. kinda wishing i would have done more research before i got it, instead of randomly picking one out a booklet at the dr."	-10
176022	my doctor took me off my pump because i was doing so well. we began with 10 units. i am now on 30 units after increasing over 4 month period. i am beginning to see some improvement but i am going to increase some more. i have used novolog with better results. i have switched doctors and hope to go to a different injector pen to keep me of a pump.	-10
37184	"worked great for a couple of months when i first started. i've had add my entire life and have never felt clear minded for focus. at first when i started vyvanse i had no side effects, after a couple months of being on it my grades were up in school but i started getting tons of side effects from it. the most notable was the social anxiety from it and having a hard time talking to people. when i first got put on this drug i was able to hold conversations with everyone but then it made me super shy and introverted... so fast forward another 3 years i was still taking this drug and actually addicted to it. everyday no matter the circumstances i would take anywhere from 30-90mg per day. stay away from this medication if you are easily addicted"	-10
51487	"so i've been on aczone for 3 full days now, and i know that's not long but i'm really impressed with this stuff! i had a sudden and embarrassing breakout on my chin/mouth area from switching to another oral birth control (instead of large cystic acne it was tiny red breakouts everywhere) and i saw an ad for this so i decided to give it a try. immediately the next say i saw it was drying a few pimples! on day 3, id say half my acne is healing or gone. i'm hoping a week from now my acne will be mostly gone. it can be drying but not anything crazy. i use the 5% gel in the morning and at night, along with my cetaphil cleanser. i don't use lotion at night but in the morning i use philosophy clear days ahead lotion and some makeup. i'll update!"	-10
66312	"i have had herpes simplex for at least 40 years. i also have genital herpes. i used to get terrible cold sores on my lips and face that made me sick, really sick. i have also gotten sores on my arms and back as well as the genital area. i started taking valtrex about 10 years ago. i now take valcyclovir which is much less expensive. for about the past 8 years, i have been on suppression therapy, 500 mg daily, and i haven't had one outbreak at all, neither on my lips or in the genital area. before going on suppression therapy, i used to get outbreaks every once in a while. i would never know when it was going to happen and sometimes the outbreaks were so bad i became physically sick. i'm so glad those days are gone."	-10
21367	"it made my blood pressure spike (190/119). this was in the late morning, early afternoon after taking, so i have to assume it was when the cns suppressive effect was wearing off. my doctor (a psychiatrist) was not interested in discussing the possible reasons for this. i had pounding in my head and pressure against my left eyeball."	-10
53070	have been on avastin since december 2008 and have had very positive effects. i am off chemotherapy for the first time in 2 1/2 years and have been in remission since the 1st of february. i feel like a new woman and i have not had any side effects.	-10
182960	"my boyfriend of 6 years began taking cymbalta 2 years, ago to deal with a bout of depression. he has completely lost all libido and he went through a terrible period of sweating - he dripped like a faucet from his armpits at times. he has lost his joy of eating, and has no appetite. he has lost 40 lbs and really did not need to. his initial &quot;feel good&quot; period in this time has worn off and he is like a robot. his doctor gp, wants to up the dosage. i want him off and i want my boyfriend back. he is like a completely different person."	-10
30944	this is my 2nd time having this happen. the 1st time was 7 years ago with monistat 3 and i remember laying on my back in the tub crying trying to rinse the &quot;hot lava&quot; out of my vagina. fast forward to now...i had a round of antibiotics for a cold and ended up with a yeast infection a week after. i got monistat 7 because walmart didn't have any better choices. my mistake. as it seeped out i could feel it burning almost as badly as the first time. this product is awful. they sell pills that cure yeast infections. make the pills over the counter! for christs sake if this were a penis problem it would be of utmost importance!!!	-10
130514	"i am 22 years old and just had my first (beautiful) daughter. i decided to get mirena when i went in for my 6 week postpartum appointment. i read all the reviews over the product about how horrible it was and how painful the insertion was. i was a little nervous but i knew this was the right birth control for me. i had no pain what so ever when my ob put it in. it was so easy! i had very light spotting the first hour or so afterwards but none since then! i'm only on day 2 so i'll do a follow up in about 6 months. but as of right now, i'll recommend it!"	-10

143408	"i got nexplanon put it in to treat my heavy, painful, &amp; length periods (anywhere from 7 - 30 days) that no pills helped. can't have estrogen because of chronic migraines. since getting it inserted in late july, i have had 4 weeks in which i didn't have the same heavy, painful periods 24/7 (it's late february now). i went to the er twice for severe dehydration (i managed to not be anemic enough to require a blood transfusion) and received 2 liters of iv fluids each time. i was prescribed meclizine for the constant dizziness from both the hormones themselves and the constant dehydration, and zofran for the constant nausea. at almost 8 months, it's coming out next week because my body is just deteriorating. back to square one. sigh."	-10
219808	"i took trazadone for depression and insomnia. stopped taking it, because my weight would not go down and i was always depressed and &quot;out of it&quot;. started taking amitriptyline i feel full of energy and not depressed. i also sleep better. i have lost 10 pounds since i started taking it 2 weeks ago. everyone is different, so please consult your doctor or pharmacist. i take 25 mg at night."	-10

226347	got nexplanon in february 2015 for irregular periods. i have now gotten my period for the third time in 6 weeks. no thanks. will probably be looking at getting it removed.	-10
113677	i've learned to 'live' with headaches; often lasting up to four days or more. i was prescribed fioricet about two years ago and i find it to be a relief not to have to 'live' with a headache for days anymore. i'm careful about using it and often as a last resort after trying advil and the like. therefore i don't find it habit forming for me. it is an absolute relief drug.	-10
219583	"took this for a week will never take this in my life again it has messed up my stomach really bad it gave me bad acid reflux nausea, vomiting - i experienced vomiting everytime i ate and drank the last 2 days today was my last day on it. i'm scared that i messed up my stomach for good. i wouldn't recommend if you have a sensitive stomach."	-10
121413	"it was the worse experience ever. i took it and couldn't sleep all night. i cried for hours and even called the emergency hotline. i had muscle stiffness, excessive yawning, nausea, and twitching. so far the worse medication i've ever taken"	-10
47843	"i started using differin in february after dealing with horrible acne my last semester of college. i think it was stress related, because i've always had pretty great skin up until then. i went to my dermatologist and he prescribed me differin and antibiotics. all i can say is there is hope!! it took me 12 whole weeks to have skin i was comfortable with, but it really does work. my skin was horrible at first when i began using it, the purge as people like to call it, and i really didn't think there was going to be a light at the end of the tunnel. but seriously week 12 hit and it was night and day. i still use it every night with some days off in between but now i am actually comfortable in my skin w/ only the occasional zit"	-10
173267	for me it has worked great. at first when i felt a panic attack coming on i took .5mg as soon as i felt it coming on and within 5-10 min i felt incredibly better. after about 3-4 months i was up to 1mg daily at most. it seemed to lose effectiveness after about 5 months so my dr has tried other medications and weened me off the klonopin. after several months of trial and error (guinea-pigging) i asked the dr to put me back on the klonopin and it has since worked great again. ive been back on it for about a month now. hope it continues to work. i rated a 9/10 only because it lost effectiveness for awhile.	-10
64465	"i have had good results with 200mg of zoloft, and .5 clonazapam 3 times a day, for ten years. i've tried many ssri meds, and zoloft has been the best so far. i suffer from depression, agoraphobia, panic and ocular migraine. this current combo ( sometimes i add gabapentin if i'm still anxious about leaving my house) has been the most effective for my mood. i gained weight on paxil and getting off was a nightmare. no additional weight gain with the zoloft."	-10

24849	"i finished the 6 day trial, and i must say i felt so good on the last 2-3 days on deplin. i didn't experience the crazy lows i had in the last few months. i don't truly have depression, more like bipolar 2, and on no medications. i love my emotions, and want to work with them, so my naturopath suggested we try deplin. i will be seeing her again next week, and i will ask her to continue it."	-10

216783	"due to an elevated cholesterol my doctor started me with crestor 5mg that was quickly increased to 10mg. my ldl almost halved, while triglycerides doubled and total cholesterol fell from 7.2 to 4.6. for 3 years regular liver function tests said all was ok. an acute event marked by fever, muscle aches, headache, dark urine, inability to sleep and total loss of appetite prompted my doctor to order blood tests, an x-ray, ultrasound and ct scan. i stopped taking crestor immediately. outcome of numerous tests could not apportion blame to flu, mosquito borne causes, etc. tests did show liver function had been walloped. liver was diagnosed as fatty and enlarged - several markers had risen alarmingly! a month later and liver function is much better."	-10
90758	"ughhh. i was on trivora and finally feeling emotionally stable when planned parenthood switched me to the &quot;off brand&quot; chateal. i read the reviews and actually convinced myself maybe i didn't need birth control at the moment because i want sexually active. this pill did not look fun. i went to a doctor and asked advice. she said pretty emotionlessly &quot;just take it&quot; the side effects should be the same as the name brand. if not, they are really just inconvenient, no biggy. yeah, easy for you to say. the reviews are right! mood swings, random crying, aggrivated easily, my skin crawls, constant sleepiness. i get home from work, sleep 5-7 then sleep again easily at midnight. more on weekends with really odd dreams. and tbd new pelvic pain. yay!"	-10
177472	complete hysterectomy 2003. went through menopause w minimal hot flashes. fast forward 2014-2016 started low dose cymbalta for back pain after back surgery. cymbalta seemed to help some w the pain. dose increased to 40mg and eventually to 60mg. hot flashes have been horrible. they come on fast and there is nothing that makes them better except sitting w a fan blowing on me. i have heard bad stories about stopping cymbalta and the side effects of that. i am fearful to stop but too hot to continue.	-10
18542	"i have suffered from papulopustular rosacea for years. i was initially prescribed met gel, which cleared it up, but it came back worse than ever. using met gel only dried my skin and made it worse. i bought soolantra out of desperation and it has worked a treat. have been using it for two weeks once at night and i currently have no white heads! my skin is also so smooth and clear now. it does get worse before it gets better, but this may be because it's killing all the dermodex mites and their life cycle including eggs is 3 weeks."	-10
115366	"had a colonoscopy with propofol. i went out quickly and didn't experience any problems during the exam. but afterwards, in recovery i felt drowsy and unbalanced when asked to get up to get dressed. it seems like you are forced to leave recovery too fast. finally, i was able to walk to the car. once we arrived home i had severe nausea and i felt like vomiting. i wasn't able to get out of the car. we called the doctor. he told me to stay reclined in the car and do not eat or drink anything. the good thing is i was in my garage away from the cold rain. after 2 hours i was able to go into the house. called doctor back. he informed me i had a reaction to the &quot;new drug&quot; aka propofol. other effects:chills, sleepy, tired. never again!!!"	-10

132623	"this medicine did not work as well for me as lunesta or ambien, but i like that it is not addicting. it is definitely better than nothing. i did feel mildly hungover the next day."	-10
104780	"not good! i've tried regular seasonique as well as loseasonique and although yes, it did get rid of my cysts after only one month, the loseasonique caused me to have breakthrough bleeding for almost the whole time that i took it (9 months). some days it was as much blood as having a period and i even had cramps and nausea that i usually have when i have a period. with regular seasonique the spotting only happened for the first pack (3 months), but still made me nauseous. but all in all, loseasonique's side effects of being in a period-like state for 9 months straight do not outweigh the benefit of helping with pcos."	-10
167034	"i am 18, 125 lbs, never had sex before this &amp; was not on birth control and this pill worked for me. the condom broke and to be sure we made a midnight walmart run for this pill. i took it about 2 hours after the accident &amp; i was freaking out and researching everything possible. four days later i started my period for the second time that month. i have never been so happy to have cramps. this pill worked for me and i really think it will work for you too!"	-10
201244	"yo so i was prescribed zoloft for depression, adult major depressive disorder, and ptsd. it has only been a couple months so maybe i'm not one to judge yet. i guess i feel okay. like i feel less extremely depressed, i'm still a sad girl tho, and honestly i feel like i could stop and feel pretty much the same. although withdrawals are a bitch. there have been weekends where i have left my pills somewhere or not gotten a re-up from my doc and believe me my boyfriend, friends, and fam can all tell something is up when i'm not on my meds. i'm just quicker to react to shit and not really okay and feel kinda insane. i'm getting off zoloft now. i wouldn't say it was bad i just need more help. i didn't feel motivated to do anything ever. soo... :/ yah"	-10
90749	"i've been on chateal for about a year and a half. i agree with many reviews that it's very effective for its intended purpose, but the side effects are awful. i've experienced extreme moodiness, irritability and depression, panic attacks, and what i believe was a burst ovarian cyst. i've also been experiencing acne on my chest and back which i've never had before. a few months ago i ended up in the er after having a severe panic attack and throwing up in the middle of the night. i can't say that the chateal was directly responsible for the burst cyst, but i'm 30 years old and have been using bc since the age of 16 -- i've never experience any of these conditions prior to using chateal, save for your standard pmsing."	-10

3971	"this medication has been a real life-saver. i had struggled with heavy depressions interspersed with hypomania for a few years before i was eventually diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, for which i was prescribed this. the initial 50mg did nothing except be an overrated sleep pill, but the boost to 300mg for bipolar depression helped begin to mellow me out, and a few weeks later i was starting to experience a life free of devastating mood swings. i've read horror stories online, but i experienced nothing of the sort (actually *lost* weight in the past few months). it's a shame there's risks with long-term use, i would happily take this forever otherwise - these past few months have been nice and happy and productive for me thanks to this."	-10
186569	"i've suffered severe depression for the last 20 years. i've been on zoloft, paxil, prozac, wellbutrin, effexor, celexa, cymbalta and lexapro. my neurologist prescribed pristiq 2 months ago. i recently told her at my follow-up visit, &quot;for the first time in 20 years, life doesn't suck.&quot; i wake up in the morning well-rested. my mind is clear. when i go to bed at night, i'm actually tired (no more insomnia!) and i sleep really well. i used to be a stress eater; now i only eat when it's meal time and have less of an appetite. the only negative side effect for me has been constipation, but it's manageable. i had pretty much given up any kind of hope that feeling better was possible. i'm glad i was wrong!"	-10
163998	using this caused my lips to bleed and all the skin on my lips turned black and it was like acid eating at my lips! i was not men remotely able to find any pain relief. from oxycodone to dilauded the er docs could not help me! nothing worked so i was sent to a pharmacist which makes compounds. we spent 3 hours we experimented with different lidocaine solutions. the raw pain even with the lidocaine was so intense that i lost my breath and couldn't breath. very scary but with this pain of simply flesh eating my lips i was not aware that pain could be this bad! i am a trauma nurse and nothing prepared me for this! any suggestions out there! i wake in a pool of blood and i am starting to see a little improvement!	-10

166795	"i had skyla for about 4.5 months. i was super excited as i am very sensitive to birth control pills. insertion was very painful and my doctor was great as she talked me through the whole process. i went back in for my 1 month check up i said that spotting only lasted 4 days. i had poking pain on my left side that never went away. after month 3 which i stuck it out she couldn't find my strings, i got an ultrasound apparently my cervix is narrow even for skyla. that's why it was poking me. brown periods lasted for 1.5 weeks after 4 months. i got it out today and the poking stopped. back to square one. everyone's body is different. i wish it worked for me!"	-10
227124	"i've had this for 5 weeks and my period is still on. i'm just fed up i'm not moody but i'm always hungry. plus it made my face break out i never get break outs. i will see in a couple more weeks if my period is supposed to stop, i read somewhere it takes about 3 months but honestly think i want to be buying pads that long."	-10

54123	"i wanted to update about my medication. i am now 20 mg. of ritalin twice daily and 50 mg. of zoloft generic once daily. having suffered bipolar depression, ptsd, add/adhd throughout different periods throughout my life. i also borderline/mild general learning disability a labeling in terms that is least offensive to mild mental retardation or borderline/mild intellectual disability. in my case the gld is extremely least severe in slightest degree. ritalin actually works very well for me while zoloft treats the anxiety, depression, and some mild obsessive compulsive behavioral thoughts but nothing extreme severe or seriousness. in some people depending dna, generics how medication effects the individual might be very different, etc."	-10
15627	"these reviews have literally changed my life. 3 months ago, cvs changed my prescription from gildess to blisovi fe 1/20 without notifying my doctor. the pharmacist said blisovi fe was a generic brand, so i didn't think anything of it. but for the last 3 months, my mental health / wellness has been horrible and i had no idea why. i went from being a very happy person to having depression, acne on my forehead and chin, an almost nonexistent sex drive (which was previously very high), anxiety, and crazy mood swings. then on a whim, i googled the side effects of blisovi fe 1/20. these reviews gave me a revelation, and i immediately stopped taking it. the only positives? didn't get pregnant, didn't gain weight. still would not recommend."	-10
94487	this has been the best pain medication i have found to relieve my back and neck pain. it has been the hardest to get prescribed. i do not understand why other then the stigma it has for the maintenance use for herion addicts. unlike other pain medicines it does not get me high and it last more then a day and i can can get by on less then ten mg a day.	-10
203816	"i started taking belsomra after my ambien became not as effective. it was expensive, but i hoped it would change my life. i've had insomnia for almost 20 years. it seemed to work ok at first, but the longer you take it, the worse it gets. sleep paralysis is just the beginning. night terrors, violent dreams and very thin sleep followed. by the time i decided to go back to ambien, i hadn't had a real sleep in months. don't bother trying."	-10
226226	"well since i've had nexplanon in i've been on my period. after three months my doctor told me to wait one more month, it's been five months now and i'm still on my period. not only that but it's horribly messed with my emotions. i had a lot of down days before but this made me develope legitamate depression to the point where i either needed to go to a therapist or find a new gynocologist to get this out of me asap."	-10
32873	"frustrating. been on this pill for about 1.5 months and i've been trying to convince myself that i'm not getting any side effects. i use to be on it back when i was 16 and i was ok, not this time. after reading some of these review i think i can finally talk to the doctor and feel like i'm not crazy. i've been a raging cow. with my 4 yr old, with my boyfriend, with life. very, very much sleepy and sad! want to just cry... have no desire to do anything. this pill is awful... didn't really want to admit or come to the realization that a little pill can have so much impact on your emotional state. wow. thank you, i feel convince now that i'm not crazy and have legitimate reasons to want to get off it."	-10

37523	"i have been taking this medicine for over two years now and when i first started taking it it turned my life around. i'm a senior in high school now and a high honors student and i credit my success mostly to the medication. after taking the 70mg dose for a long amount of time i have noticed that the benefits of the pill have decreased. now, the medicine wears off within five hours of taking it. compared to before when it would last all day. i do not feel as focused as i used to while taking it, i do not feel the loss of appetite anymore, and i am becoming more forgetful."	-10
64758	"i have been on escitalopram for 10 years, i am in full blown menopause, and my anxiety and depression has increased, the doc has put me on sertraline 50mg, i'm on day 4 and feel sick and keep having bouts of tearfulness, just wandering how long it has took for this to pass, i hate having this all over again"	-10
94041	"took 10mg samples in the am, nausea and dizziness big problem 3rd and 4th day. stopped for 2 days. then took 1/2 pill in the evening around 8pm. a little nausea, sleep was affected but adjusting. but i believe it is what i need. i left the house 3 times on the weekend, answered my phone, went into 6 stores and most important, while home didn't lay in bed."	-10
61390	"i had a hysterectomy in 1998 and was on premarin 0.0625 for many years then doctor decided not good to prescribe anymore. i was so very miserable! if have to live like that -don't want to. it was terrible. no doctor knows your body like you do! and just for the record, one of my sisters is 73 yrs old aznd still has terrible hot flashes! sometimes it looks as if she just stepped out of the shower! my mother was the same way! i am not willing to live like that! there are pro's and con's on everything!"	-10
79546	"i took the morning after pill after the condom slipped right before ovulation. i have been pregnant and the side effects made me feel exactly the same way as when i was pregnant. my period was five days late and i was convinced that i was pregnant. two days after i started my period, the symptoms subsided."	-10
222651	"been on this for just a week now at 25 mg also on 50 mg of amitriptalyne of a night. the first few days i felt really spaced out, but sort of kept coming in waves through the day. i also suffer from m.e as well but have found the past few days i have had lots of energy. i don't feel tired at all. supposed to up dose to 50 mgs on second week, but i'm thinking may stick to the 25 for a little while to see how things go. no migraines up to now. reading all the reviews most of the side effects seem to come when the dose is increased. really worried about the hair loss business, don't think i could deal with that one . think i'm going to give this a go for a few months and see how things go, it's all trial and error, or kill or cure."	-10
148806	my periods have been incredibly irregular. i bleed every time i am sexually active.	-10
230521	"i have been on depo for 3.5 years now and the first entire year i had spotting almost everyday. after that i would only get my period about a week after i would get a new shot which last at least a full week but are very light. i love this birth control because i don't have to remember to take a pill every day. i didn't experience weight gain, i actually lost weight after taking the shot but i did experience some acne which i am not sure is because of the depo or just minor adult acne. i definitely recommend this method for birth control!"	-10
107897	"the patch worked fine until this week. just recently the patch would start to come off my skin very early. my most recent patch came off 4 days early. what was under the patch is what i am warning you about. my skin was blistered with bubbles, and my skin was raised almost half an inch. it looked as if my skin had a chemical burn from the medication. i slept with some gauze on it and i cleaned it with peroxide. the next day the skin was an open wound and bright red like a burn. it is the most painful thing i've felt in a while. the worst part was being rushed to the er due to a possible blood clot in the lung (horrible chest pains), had ct scans, blood drawn, and ivs placed all over my body. before this, i had experienced constant fatigue"	-10
161917	"the severe side effect after only 2nd pill of cramps in calves, legs and shoulders were not worth the medications use. very scary. no one told me the damage could be permanent, not dr or pharmacy- this should be advised up front. will never use again."	-10
170220	"i was prescribed seroquel for ptsd. never again. 25 mg, i had the worst panic attack if my life, i could barely walk, but i was so scared i kept trying to run around. it was horrible. i went absolutely crazy then passed out hard. not my kind of medication. my mother inlaw takes 250 mg a day for schizophrenia, she has for six months now, so far it is not helping her delusions, hallucinations, paranoia. she was told to take it at supper time and seemed drunk and sedated all evening. she now takes it at bed time but it is not helping her. :("	-10
436	"i've been on depo-provera for about 6 weeks now. as for my period it's been amazing. i haven't gotten my period once and i've gotten spotting once and it last around 2 seconds. unfortunetly about once a week i get excruciating migraines to the point where i can't see. also i am having such bad hair loss i'm starting to get worried. i'm also finding some foods i love, are making me nauseous and i've became slightly claustrophobic. the worst of all though are my constant mood swings. i am constantly mad over nothing at my boyfriend. almost every other day i seem to get really mad out of no where. it's like i'm not myself. depression isn't really an issue but it comes with my mood swings. i also have no sex drive whatsoever."	-10
90813	"i was prescribed norco 5/325 to manage post-operative pain from a tooth extraction. the first time i took it, i took one pill became really nauseous and didn't feel any pain relief. the second time i took 2 pills. i didn't develop nausea, which was good, but i also didn't experience any pain relief or drowsiness. it was like i hadn't taken anything at all."	-10

76663	i took the first pill yesterday around 8 am and it worked right away. by 4pm my stomach was a bit queasy so i ate some dinner. by 6 pm i was feeling sick to my stomach with pain and nausea. i went to the bathroom a couple of times and was still very nauseated. by 2am i was throwing up. i then took some anti nausea meds and finally fell asleep by 4am. i woke up around 8:30am no longer nauseated but felt like i got hit by a freight train. i've been on the couch all day taking mini naps. it is now 7pm and i'm finally starting to feel better. i called the pharmacy to see if i could get a refund but they said no. i can see how the meds work but not at the physical cost of being deathly ill. i hope this works for someone else.	-10
14530	i now have been on suboxone for about 1 year now and i feel great. i used oxy's and hydro's and was also on heroin for about 6 years. i just can't stop thinking about the day that i said that i can't live my life this way. so i got on this site and found a doctor who has helped me and has also been my friend through my up's and down's. i haven't relapsed the whole time i've been on it and i thank god for this drug. for the doctor who is not only my doctor but my friend.	-10
5709	"while i was taking evoxac i had severe body odor, and my genitals smelled like onion. i tried everything to clear it up, over several years and nothing helped. the day i stopped taking evoxac, the condition cleared up immediately. for the last 10 days it has not returned. i'm grateful my new doctor refused to subscrjibe a refill for evoxac when i requested it. she told me the side effect was fatigue and she asked me to try other ways to address my dry mouth. after i stopped taking it, i noticed the very next day, for the first time in years, my strange body odor was gone. i do not recommend this drug for anyone who cares about how they smell &quot;down there.&quot;"	-10
6996	i love this stuff... the only thing i dont like is how it feels like it's burning! i don't sweat at all with it! i love it	-10
198592	"i would never use this! going into my 4th year i started having pains in my pelvic area that lasted 30mins-6hrs. it would wake me up, at the time i had these intense pains i would bleed then it would just stop. went to ob and got a pelvic ultrasounds, i had tremendous blood clots in my uterus that wouldn't pass. the shot stopped working and stored my monthly flow on my uterus the dr said seemed like it stopped working for at least a year. had to get cervical dilation to see if it'll come out, it didn't so a couple days later i got a d&amp;c. it's been 3 weeks since and i'm having heavy bleeding. which i think is only because my hormones are off! do not get on this shot!!! hopefully i can get something to regulate this!"	-10

26280	"i began taking this pill in may, after having my second child. the nurse at the clinic told me to wait at least three months, as the symptoms would subside. they didn't. i have experienced irregular bleeding, heavier than normal bleeding, cramping, my skin looks worse than it ever has, the bloating is terrible - i have gained 15 pounds since starting this pill, i've had more headaches, severe fatigue, and have been just down right moody. it has done the job of preventing pregnancy, but then again it has given me the sex-drive of an elderly woman. would not recommend."	-10
4811	i have a different experience then i'm reading here i've completed 10 days and haven't lost anything in fact i gained a pound i had previously lost.	-10
157142	"i have suffered from mild to moderate acne for almost the past 10 years and for the past few years it has been quite moderate and under control- not perfect but not terrible by any means. however, i went on yasmin bc and within 4 days i was experiencing the worst breakout of my life. my right cheek, whole chin and jaw line was just awful. i got prescribed differin asap and for the past week i have been combining with coconut oil when i apply at night to 'water it down' so to speak. my blemishes are fading so quick! ive had a few new ones, an ib i imagine, but they are going as quick as they come. i am really happy and can't recommend enough. this is differin cream and not gel. i have tried duac in the past and it wasnt even close!!!"	-10
151130	"i have taken oxycodone for 2 years now. i had back surgery to repair a vertebrae that had been destroyed by cancer. i was on morphine for a while, but my wife complained that i was loopy on it. the oxycodone has been much better in that regard as well as pain relief. i take 40mgs twice a day and am very happy with the results."	-10
138232	"this product seemed to work really fast but sometimes it wouldn't take care of all the pain from the migraine. also, i noticed when i do a hard body workout at the gym and if i get a migraine the next day or two, after that workout the medicine made my body ache real bad. my chest, arms, and legs would really hurt from the constricting blood vessels."	-10
209690	"i would like to address women who already struggle with depression, insomnia, or mood disorders, like myself. if you're already bad off don't do this to yourself, it might be the final &quot;push&quot;. i got the 3month shot (+add-back) and it made me suicidal. my moods went from extreme anger to sobbing, insomnia, hot flashes, and my left arm kept going numb in daily activities! this went on for a month, at 2 months i leveled out. not far into the 3'rd month the hot flashes came back, cold sweats (felt like drug withdrawal), and my pain was back! i went to my ob/gyn 1 week early because of this to find i had grown 11 new painful cysts! it didn't even work, and to stop it is also unpleasant (withdrawals). worst med decision i ever made! hell!"	-10
148448	"i've had the mirena for 6 weeks for heavy prolonged periods. insertion wasn't painful, just uncomfortable. i had cramping for a couple of days after. i have had constant bleeding everyday since insertion although not anywhere near on the scale i was having pre mirena. however since insertion i have noticed i have very low mood, really bad anxiety, greasy skin, joint pain, very tearful, hair loss and hair growth on face is worse (i do have pcos) i generally do not feel like myself. would not recommend this to anyone, yet i have friends who love it."	-10

159683	"it's the silver bullet! well, for me at least. i can only add my highest recommendation for bactrim to treat my cystic acne, the kind that produces cysts around 2-3 cm in diameter all over my body and face. i've been on accutane and every other antibiotic there is, but the bactrim has saved me. it is hard on your digestive system, and i still haven't come up with a good solution for that yet, but i can certainly live with it if it means no more painful cysts which need to be cut out and operated on medically (no fun at all). i've always had cystic acne, but the bactrim seems to kill the bacteria that produce the cysts, so as long as it keeps working i'm happy."	-10
36516	having chronic pain in my whole spine they gave me the fentanyl patch they started low dosage then they moved me up to 75mg. at this time in my life i was also had hot flashes. i seen no warnings nothing about that. long story short after the second day i started withdrawing and that people is not a pretty site. i had no idea what was going on. so i never went back on it. there should be a warning to all doctors and pharmacies. i had to pull it off the internet to show my pharmacy.	-10
176294	"instead of calming me down and relaxing me from my anxiety and panicky feelings it made them extremely worse. i thought i was going to loose my mind. well actually for a brief time i did. it caused me to have a nervous breakdown. this was only on the second day i took it. i didn't know what was going on or what was happening. i thought i was going to loose my mind and before i knew it i slit one of my wrist. i have never had any intention of doing this before taking ativan. thankful help came and i got 8 staples put in my wrist were i cut it. i will never take this medicine ever again. i just warn to be very careful taking this medicine. i have never had any reactions to medicines before until this medicine i took back in sept 16, 2015."	-10
155610	"i came back from cuba with a sinus infection about two weeks ago.. my doctor prescribed an antibiotic that i normally used in the past, long story short i got a very nasty case of diarrhea after the 4th day. started going to the bathroom over 7 times a day (i literally lost count).. went to the walk-in clinic again and they said that it could be due to c.difficile and asked me to do a stool test.. said i should book an appointment in 10 days when the results got back.. i waited two days and broke.. went back to them and said there is no point in waiting as all i did all day was go to the bathroom. needless to say after one metronidazole pill it did the trick. hallelujah! best 15 dollars i ever spent!! i am going to pass out candy boxes today."	-10
45095	"i've been depressed for most of my life but was raised to &quot;tough it out&quot;. i am a recovering opioid addict so i am scared to take any medication at all. the last 3 years i've completely withdrawn from any social activities, relationships &amp; have just been doing the bare minimum to get by. recently my oldest son turned 18 &amp; has severed ties with me. this took me to the lowest low i've ever been &amp; made me suicidal. for the sake of my younger son, i chose to get help. i was put on 20mg of prozac &amp; have been on it for 3 weeks. i wish i would have done this sooner. through my recovery from opioids, i've learned that pills are not the answer so these combined with counseling is the solution i've needed for a long time. i hope this helps others."	-10
148709	"i have had mirena for 3 months now and i have been bleeding every day since. they said 3 months of irregular bleeding and spotting, they never said anything about having a perminant light period. i'm so over it...."	-10

225005	wellbutrin xl has been great for me. i have been on it for a few months and have completely noticed the difference in my lifestyle and my libido. my doctor was giving me samples of the brand name but she ran out and my insurance wouldn't cover the brand. my copay for the brand was $1300.00 i could not afford that so she reluctantly put me on the generic. it was horrible. worst experience of my life. worst side effects ever. luckily i came across another pharmacy and they fill your wellbutrin brand name for $50 a month. it's been great! back on wellbutrin and feeling amazing!!	-10
72443	"i find tramadol to be a wonderful pain reliever. i take it for chronic migraines and joint pain. i find that 100 mgs for the migraine works, however 300 mgs is needed for the joint pain. i get a little loopy, definitely itchy, but my mood is stable and i'm pain free."	-10
15303	"i had hives and an allergic reaction to blisovi... it was substituted by my pharmacy after i was taking lomedia which i enjoyed taking for two years. three weeks into taking it, hives all over my stomach and somewhat on my arms. my lips were swollen and dry. i discontinued it and immediately had to be switched by my doctor. i can't recommend this drug at all."	-10
42730	"i have been on the patch for about 3 months now, i used to have severe headaches every day before starting xulane. now i rarely get them - only on my period. i also have not had any issues with the patch coming off, if anything it is hard to take off at the end of each week and actually quite painful! also, the week before my period and during my period, i have intense mood swings and become extremely irritable and emotional. so, 2 weeks out of 4 in every month, i feel pretty terrible. i am considering stopping the patch completely, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage."	-10
172603	"i started having panic attacks that rendered me unable to even get up. my first one landed me in the hospital. i was disoriented, rooms looked like they were sideways, objects that were not moving looked like they were, i couldn't get enough air in, i needed to close my eyes, driving was out of the question and i was nauseated and terrified. after two weeks of being out of work i was put on klonopin along with antidepressants. it is the only thing that has allowed me to function like i could before the panic/anxiety attacks started. the only drawback is that i have to take it at the same time each day and cannot miss a doseage or the dizziness, panic and feeling like i am going to pass out comes back. it has been a life saver."	-10
202681	"this was not the answer for me, i developed a bad rash and itching over my entire body and now my ears ring and that will never go away. just from taking it for under a month."	-10
128377	i've been on phentermine 30mg for 9 weeks and have lost only 6.2#. that averages out to less than 3/4# weight loss per week. i went to my doctor today to report how it was working and we decided to crank it up to the 37mg dosage. only time will tell how that works but i'm quite disappointed in the results. i was hoping for much better results. :(	-10
225185	"hi, i'm 18 years old.. i started taking wellbutrin 3 months ago when my psychiatrist put me on. i looked up reviews up in here, and recommended i should be prescribed. anyway, the first couple months are horrible but don't give up! 1 month ago all my problems with prozac were alleviated my focus was 10x better (i also have adhd so my grades skyrocketed)! and my depression died..yes died, i laugh so much now people at my school ask me why i laugh so much it's refreshing actually. anyway... prozac gave me severe loss of libido (on a serious note) i'm 18 so it bothered me horribly that i had a low sex drive on prozac after months on end of taking prozac my libido became ed.... and i lived a fairly healthy life trust me. wellbutrin fixed my problems"	-10

52370	"i have used this for 2 months and it changed my life, after 3 years of pain and seeing doctor after doctor for what i thought was gallbladder pain but the last 2 days i've not been feeling good, same old symptoms are back (not sure if it's something i ate or what ) heading back to doctor in 2 days.. overall this medicine has helped me tremendously for the past 2 months !!!!"	-10

164206	"this product works very well to eliminate skin cancers. it becomes quite irritating after a few days, and very irritating at about 10 days, but it gets rid of the skin cancer in a couple of weeks."	-10
87211	"i just started taking latuda, and have found it makes me very sleepy, i'm wondering if i should take it at night instead of the morning. i was on wellbutrin but had to be taken off because of extreme anxiety and emotionality."	-10
95529	this worked for a while then i started getting rebound headaches. i was waking up to excruciating headaches in the mornings after taking these at night after a period of time. they can increase with intensity over time. if you find this happening to you. you need to get off of them. they are rebound headaches.	-10
63999	"i was on zoloft due to depression and anxiety. i am an army veteran who was diagnosed with gad and mild to moderate depression. i have been on a variety of medications, however this one was hell. i couldn't concentrate, my insomnia was worse (i had to take melatonin in order to sleep), i was lightheaded almost everyday. the one thing i hate was being irritated easily were when it came to my family asking me questions, i just wanted to be violent."	-10
109385	"i was on the depo shot for 2 years. with depo i gained 15 pounds over the 2 years. although this isn't much, it's a lot for a short person (i'm 4'11&quot;). i had heavy bleeding for a whole year on depo, then eventually i stopped getting my period (which is great because they were extremely painful). with nexplanon, i had light spotting for 3 days and haven't had a period since. also, i lost 8 pounds in the 3 months that i've had nexplanon without changing diet or exercise after switching. my only complaint is sometimes if you put pressure on where it's implanted, you can feel it poking. i avoid my son or husband laying on my arm because of it."	-10
227218	"i've had nexplanon for about a year and 2 months now. it's really great to me. the insertion was painless. my cycle is kind of off balance though. i can say i had my period four times and every time it was for like 3 to 4 days. the acne is horrible i get it in my face, back and chest. no weight gain and slight hair loss nothing major. but overall i do recommend it. it beats getting a shot every couple months and taking a pill everyday."	-10
112391	"pretty much saved my life. 13 years ago fibromyalgia symptoms (severe pain especially legs and shoulders), started. my father was taking high doses of gabapentin for chronic guillaune barre. he urged me to try it--and it was the first real sleep i had in months! my rheumatologist had me on 1600mg. 3x, gradually lowered to 1600 mg. 2x. studies at mayo clinic and johns hopkins show very few (and very mild) side effects, even at high doses. the only problem i have is if i forget to take them. then i get flu like symptoms. i was able to continue my career (elementary school teacher) with no problems. retired this year age 66 and very active. btw my memory seems better than most friends my age."	-10
209414	i have recently gone to a headache specialist after thinking no one is going to help me with my migraines and constant tension headaches. she gave me zomig and it does really work. the first time i tried it i wasn't 100% sure my headache was a migraine since it felt different then the one i've always experienced. it wasn't throbbing from front to back all on one side but it did really hurt bad all on one side. i was pleasantly surprised. maybe it was a different kind of migraine since i have just weaned off of excedrin and 2 years of tramadol use. a couple of days ago i had a bothersome headache that had been off and on in intensity for 2 days then turned into the normal migraine i have been accustomed to and the zomig took care of it.	-10
79358	i am on birth control but take it very sporadically so when i had sex about two months ago and the condom broke i went out right away and got plan b. my first period came and went normally but for my last one i only spotted for one day. now i am freaking out and am due for my next period in a week and a half and i might end up getting a pregnancy test before then because i am really scared i might be pregnant and the side effects don't say anything about messing with your second period after taking the product.	-10
57643	"i used the medication and was doing better than i had been in years, then suddenly i was switched off of it due to the new law and haven't been able to be put back on it since. don't understand why. i was told it was taken off the market."	-10
55070	i love this it is my miracle on a bottle. i was extremely skeptical when my doctor brought it up. i had never in my 58 years used any weight loss med. there are challenges but i no longer think about food. i can turn down sweets and i no longer drink any soda. i eat way less and my body lets me know what it needs. i have lost 40 lbs in 5 months. i too suffered side effects especially when i went to 4 pills a day. so for a month i took the 4 pills but i broke them up 1 pill at a time. that was the only month i did not lose weight. but when i started back to the correct dosage no more side effects and the weight started coming off. hang in there. for me it works.	-10

125436	"i use a pill form it said to take 3 for my age. i did so, did around at 7 pm. it did not work until the next day at 8 am i woke up feeling like i have to poop but i actually vomited everything i ate the night before i got the shakes n fainted for a few seconds. now its later i. the day n i'm doing diarrhea but now there blood i assume...still feel constipated"	-10
209230	"i have been on geodon for 3 years now, and i like it better than other bipolar medicines! but the downside is i forget things really easy, and also i can't remember things from years ago like i should. people tell me things i have no idea what they are talking about. i manic every once in a while, i take 60mg in mornings and 60mg at bedtime. it hasn't gave me trouble with my heart, and my blood pressure stays great. i hope this helps. i am trying to cope with it without changing medicines."	-10
106858	"i have been on this for about 2 years, i barely get any periods mostly just spotting, no weight gain, you don't have to think about it but every other three years, and it just goes in your arm. i think it's the best birth control out there for now. i think it is perfect for me but everyone's body will react differently."	-10
231178	"i've been on the therapy 4 month now and it does knock you about, but after 2 month, the viral load was undetectable in my blood, hurrah! ! my side effects are manageable, but the reduction of red blood cell count is a bit worrying. i'm doing a blood test every 2wks and at this moment, my dr has reduced the ribavirin intake from 5 to 4 tablets per day. all in all i must say, i'm glad this treatment is available and you have a very good chance of being healed. it is very important to keep busy, rest when tired and get up and go again."	-10
163774	"great medication, worked like magic for me. however, the major side effect that makes me stop it is the weight gain aspect. it makes me eat all the time and have cravings to sugar all day long. i have been on and off remeron for the last 5 years and the only reason that i am off it is the weight gain. i have tried many many medications but nothing worked for me. remeron is the only anti-depressant that gives me back my life."	-10
217594	i started taking biaxin two days ago for both a dental abscess and chronic bronchitis. so far i haven't noticed a difference but it may take a while. horrible taste in my mouth and very sleepy. all in all it's not a bad medication so far.	-10
75762	"i have suffered from complex insomnia (trouble falling asleep as well as trouble staying asleep), secondary to severe major depressive disorder, for many years. i have lost count of the sleep meds that worked for a while until i developed a tolerance. i have walked a tightrope between meds that don't help at all and those that make me sleep all day. my current solution is a combination of temazepam to help me fall asleep and seroquel to help me stay asleep. it's the result of a lot of trial and error, and it is regulating my sleep better than anything i have ever experienced. now if can just avoid building up a tolerance..."	-10

28352	"i've been on lexapro for two months now. the first 4 weeks i had very minor side effects. dry mouth, dilated pupils, etc. very minor and only lasted 2 days each. two months later i can tell you this medication is amazing. i suffered from very periodic anxiety which turned into panic attacks on some occasions. it was always in the back of my mind as to if or when it was going to happen. that's no way to live. i feel focused with clear thought now. i still laugh and feel every emotion...i just don't worry about things like i used to before lexapro. i'm happier and have a more positive outlook on difficult situations in my life now. i find myself being much more social now too. miracle medication for sure!"	-10
119745	"well i have been on ambien cr 12.5 mg for close to 6 years now and absolutely love it. i think it is the best thing since sliced bread. i developed insomnia when i started doing shift work and tried everything under the sun starting with melatonin, benadryl, restoril and all the new ones that have come out since and although some were helpful with helping me fall asleep, they did not keep me asleep past the 3-4 hour mark..so the ambient cr has been great for me."	-10
104222	i was taking lutera and doing great with it. my pharmacy made me switch because lutera was being discontinued. i am on my third week of this medication and have not been feeling well. i have been moody and agitated and feeling as if i am in a fog.	-10
215538	"i would give this a minus rating (-100). i compare my experience with the paragard to a medieval torture device , it bought me to my knees no women deserves the horrors of the paragard , yes i may be in the minority for those of us that find it can cause copper toxicity. i wish i had been informed of this because it truly is horrendous how it randomly picks it victims. this device truly has the power to completely shatter your world and make you loose your smile . please avoid"	-10
175673	"i was prescribed this for a kidney infection. i took one dose. with that dose i felt so sick to my stomach, had horrible anxiety, my face felt hot and i felt sweaty. my calves of my legs also felt sore. i stopped after that first dose because i felt so awful and read some pretty scary side effects! i went to a different dr and he put me on doxy which is much safer."	-10

184686	"i tried the traumeel another user suggested. it did nothing to help with the pain. the only relief i have found so far is tylenol, extra strength and aquaphor once everything has been pulled to the surface. of course keeping the affected areas uncovered is a huge help. i sleep on a beach towel over my sheets so the shedding and peeling are &quot;contained&quot;. it's the only way i don't itch throughout the night and even if i do, the roughness of the towel helps to get it off the skin. hope this helps."	-10

151603	"i smoked on and off since i was 19. i am now 48. i started chantix on 7/2/15 and my last cigarette was on 7/8/15. so far so good! i tried chantix about 6 months ago and kept smoking thinking that i would &quot;miraculously&quot; stop smoking. that's not possible if you keep buying cigarettes! this time, i started off with the 1mg 2x a day...not the &quot;starter pack&quot; and i think that made a difference for me. it worked a lot quicker. it is now only $30 copay on my insurance so i decided to try again and it is working."	-10
143121	"i've been on nexplanon for about one and a half years now. the first 6 months seemed pretty regular. i had no signs of weight gain, my periods were normal. everything seemed ok until about a year into it, i started noticing i was gaining some weight. i started to have mood swings and felt very depressed most of the time. it got so bad to the point that it started affecting mine and my husbands relationship. not only that, but i started to gain a significant amount of weight i probably gained about 35 pounds and a good 5 to 6 months. i exercised everyday. i ate very healthy and couldn't shed a pound. i have made a appt. to have this removed."	-10
133586	it made me want to crawl out of my own skin! constant jumping legs and strange sensations all over my body. no sleep whatsoever. maybe i am allergic.	-10
182776	i had/having a horrible time with this medication. currently trying to wean off with my mds help. i've had every listed side effect and subsequent health problems that required expensive work ups. most dramatically i developed vertigo and severe headaches after being on the med for about 3-4 months. vertigo was debilitating and required time off of work and multiple doctor appointments to rule out other conditions. i also had electrical zings and numbness and tingling down my body. the weaning has been the most problematic causing these awful side effects to worsen. i'm a registered nurse and i would never recommend this drug to anybody. i did not feel any benefits for my depression.	-10
205743	completely changed my outlook on life. tried it 2 months ago didn't seem to work initially but now i can definitely notice a difference. i was having a lot of trouble just functioning like a regular person but this has brought back the old me. i really am grateful. if i don`t take it for a day or take it late in the day i start feeling depressed again so yes it works.. try it.	-10
185129	day4 on harvoni no side effects. already have more energy. i also take harvoni at night about an hour after dinner. can't wait for blood work. thank you goodness for a new lease on life! death to hep c!!!	-10
15072	"this completely broke me out in fluid filled hives all over my heck, chest, shoulders, back, etc. i assume i am allergic to one of the hormones in it. as soon as i stopped taking it, the acne and hives went away. as for a time frame, i took it for 3 days when the acne started. stopped after a month. took another month for the acne to completely go away. this could just be me, because i tried the iud next and was the 1% of women that it didn't work for - my body expelled it and wouldn't allow it to stay in place. however, i would not recommend this pill to a friend."	-10
185973	"seems to have worked well in reducing cancer/psa. minimal side effects except for both hands. both hands are painful when moved and big knuckles can be very hurtful when holding an object. warmth helps, as does minimising hand movements. can hold a tennis ball without problems. a golf ball with some effort and pain, and a pen or small object can be a big problem to grasp."	-10
225969	i've been taking wellbutrin for about 1 month. i really want this medication to work but i'm having all side effects. started with a bad taste in my mouth and went to headache and really dizzy and nauseous. ( i will go off if this doesn't go away). today i'm having some chest pain but it feels a little worse than the anxiety chest pain i was having so i'm not sure what to think of that. i have been on prozac and then celexa for 10 years and i wanted to try this for the less sexual side affects. that has worked and i feel more sensitive to the things that should make you cry. i really want this to work but the side effects are hard. i'll stick with it and hope they go away soon.	-10
35550	"needed to stop taking due to red, swollen and painful joints side effect. tried stopping then starting again but side effect occurred again."	-10
54292	took 25 mg yesterday am and slept for 5 hours. i am also a spinal cord injured person and that plays a big role in bowel incontinence. will speak to pharmacist about lowering dose. also some reviews insinuate they dropped methadone because of movantek. would appreciate comments from those who have done this.	-10
64448	i took zoloft for anxiety and panic attacks. it worked the first day! only downside of this is i felt tired and zombie like. but it definitely helps.	-10
31286	"i got the 3 generic cream prefills from cvs. first night, the inside of my vagina began to immediately burn and itch, to the point to where i was crying and doing yoga breathing to work through the pain. i washed it out and, took tylenol, and finally fell asleep. i began to feel discomfort on my pubic area, like razor burn. upon inspection, i saw that my entire pubic area was broken out in painful, itchy bumps and even onto my thighs. stupidly, i gave the cream applicators another chance, and it was so much worse the second time. i showered to get the medication out. i've used the suppositories before and never had this problem, so i will definitely be going back to those. this should be taken off the shelves!"	-10
181126	i was having redness and itching due to allergies and i used the visine totality. it made my eyes burn and i couldn't see for 10 minutes. it amplified the symptoms i was already having. i'm scared to use this product because it's painful and i wasn't expecting it to burn.	-10
223370	i like zyrtec but i seem to have a strange metallic taste in my mouth. i can't find this listed as a side effect?	-10
15779	"okay i haven't been on this pill very long, but my doctor prescribed it to me for heavy bleeding and intense cramps. he told me to skip the brown pills and start a new pack instead. doing that i wasn't supposed to have a period at all. well that isn't the case at all. the last two days have been pure hell with cramps. (worse than before) and i'm bleeding heavier than usual ( i didn't think it was possible). not to mention the migranes are unreal."	-10
155322	"my doctor prescribed me this medication for bv (first time having it) 2 x tablets a day, i'm only on day 3 (2 days to go) and i can already notice a difference no more smell and i just feel fresher down there. the tablets are disgusting! the metallic taste was a first for me today but have been feeling a bit odd. nausea hasn't been too much of a problem but it seems i've been going to the toilet a lot."	-10
3009	macrobid did nothing to eliminate my uti. it was a failure just like amoxicillian. i was a bit nauseous at first but nothing that affected me. i took it for ten days.	-10
230169	my son was diagnosed with tourettes and he is 10yrs old. the medicine has helped a little with his tics but still does some. his anger is getting worse while on this medication and has gained alot of weight in the half a year he has been on this medication.	-10
139015	this is my 4th day on phentermine. i have lost 4+ lbs. i had a headache the first day and no other side effects.	-10
209159	i had a back spasm. the pain went on for almost two weeks. i got a prescription for skelaxin. it did nothing for me. taking 800mg of ibuprofen did a better job.	-10
86355	"i took this and a couple of weeks later had to have an endoscopy due to severe abdominal pain. it contains sucralose, so if you are allergic to that, look out. i would not recommend it to anyone who has a sensitive stomach."	-10

154172	"i was prescribed nexium 40mg approx 2 years ago at our local hospital after being diagnosed as having a quantity of small duodenal ulcers. no side effects were evident for the first week or so but then i started to feel aches and pains all too easily, later developing mood swings, quite extreme at times. i informed my doctor who dismissed my claims,( i do not lie! )after just under the two years of taking nexium, i decided to take things into my own hands, i discovered slippery elm capsules. i am now into my fifth month of taking only one capsule a day having weaned myself off the nexium, interspersed with slippery elm in the first week. i now have no side effects and with care have little or no acid indigestion."	-10
176010	its been 12 hours and my eyes are so much worse now than a day ago. the pus is coming out so fast i can't keep my vision clear. the watering of the eyes is terrible my skin around the outside corners of the eyes and under burn like road rash with alcohol poured over it. almost feel like going to the emergency room for relief cause its just getting harder and harder to tolerate. i rated it at its current level of help and relief so if it improves i will bookmark and come back to edit.	-10
73683	i was on this pill for 4 months. the pros: periods were light and predictable. the cons: nausea and hair loss/thinning. after the results of the hair situation i got off of this pill.	-10
108550	almost halfway through my second week i had to stop taking contrave because it jacked up my blood pressure. bp probably would've been a lot higher than the 156/93 had i not been talking blood pressure medication already.	-10
165780	"i told myself i would write a review once i got my next period. here i am! i'd been told it works by everyone i know, but of course i did the absolute worst thing you can do and that's searching google until you've actually been convinced you're pregnant because of some blog or comment. i bet most of you, if not all, are doing the same thing right now or you wouldn't be reading this! do not do this to yourself. i had sex, the condom broke, and my boyfriend came inside me. even worse, it was the day i was supposed to be ovulating. took the plan b one-step about 6 hours later. cramped really bad a day later. about 5 days later i spotted for about 4 days. my period skipped a month as well. so if you are late, do not panic!! plan b does work!"	-10
149066	this is my second mirena i have has in. no pain with getting it inserted and no periods for 10 years. i am now 50 years old and i'm overdue by 12 months to get it removed. going in october. is has been the best thing for me and i would recommend it to anyone with terrible bleeding i couldn't cough sneeze without have blood all over the floor. had to sit on the toilet for hours until the bleeding would slow down. best thing ever.	-10
149146	"i had decided to get mirena as i am horrible at remembering to take pills. i have never had children and they aren't in my plans. at age 34 i had it inserted and it hurt more than i thought it would. it reduced my period frequency &amp; the amount, but it completely killed my sex drive, which now, 2 years later is still non existent. i felt depressed soon afterwards and it never went away. i gained 20 pounds, which is odd as i eat well most of the time &amp; go jogging with my boyfriend. even he is now convinced that my lack of a sex drive, weight gain &amp; inability to loose weight is a side effect of the mirena. i just made an appointment to have it removed &amp; plan to next just get my tubes tied."	-10
101228	"this medicine wrecked me. i had a drug induced psychosis, they had no business putting me on this. the only positive is that it did snap me back into reality, but some clean time would have done that. i have gained weight all in my stomach, i developed akathisia that lasted 2 months after discontinuing. also extreme anhedonia which can persist for up to a year. i hope i return to normal way before that. please only attempt this med if you don't know which way is up."	-10
51261	horrible drug. you feel sicker than before and the nausea does keep you up at night even if you try to eat more. i hate it. not taking it anymore and i saw online it can cause heart electrical signals to go chaotic according to fda. so why are they still prescribing this?	-10
169221	"i am almost 20 years old and was diagnosed about 3.5-4 weeks ago. i got a lumbar puncture and then started diamox and it has been an awful experience.the first week and a half i was severely exhausted had nausea and the taste issue and basically wasn't functional. then for about a week or so i seemed to be getting better until a few days ago when i've been very rapidly getting new symptoms/side effects like severe joint pain, itchy scalp, and waking up with my eyelids swollen half shut and then this morning my lips where extremely swollen. i had to go to the er to make sure it wasn't an allergic reaction but it seems to be just a weird reaction to the meds (not allergic). i hate it. if i didn't have to take it, i wouldn't."	-10
182207	"i've been on clomipramine 15 years now and basically saved my life. i suffer terrible panic attacks but they stopped straight away/. i come off my 25 mg tablets for 9 months, felt good but slowly my panic attacks came now back on 25 mg and feel good again."	-10
35143	"worst stuff i have ever used ended up in the er was so scared, it killed me with back and knee' pain could not get out of bed without screaming, never again!"	-10
85335	i've been on this birth control for the last 7 years. i love it. i always know exactly when i'm going to get my period and they only last 4-5 days. i do get moody right before and breast soreness/cramping the day of but its not anything crazy. no weight gain and my skin still breaks out around my period. i've never been pregnant so that's definitely a plus too!	-10
5141	i've been on this pill for 3 months and i've gained 10 pounds. i'm bloated the first two weeks of my pills. it's terrible. i always start in the middle of my row of my active pills and my period is long. like 8 days. not happy. i'm calling to switch. i switched from minastrin fe which was terrible too.	-10
180212	"i have been taking diclegis for 2 weeks now and i feel amazing. taking 3 pills a day seems to be the magic dose for me. i previously tried zofran which helped minimally but i was still nauseous and vomiting violently a few times throughout the day. i work full time so i really needed something more effective so my doctor recommended i try diclegis. two thumbs up, just a little pricey."	-10
131839	i have been on effexor xr 150 mg for 20 years it certainly has help with my suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. i also take 2 x 1mg of xanax. i started seeing a new primary care doctor yesterday who thinks i should be taken off both since i have been on it for so long but i have read some awful things about the withdrawal problems and it makes me scared.	-10
151516	"i am officially a non smoker for the first time in 25 years. chantix has been a miracle for me and it less than 2 weeks to quit. i'm so happy and would recommend it to anyone. i also haven't had any side effects with the drug. good luck, hope this helps whoever is reading this and i also want you to know, if i can quit.....you can too!!!&amp;"	-10
85484	"before switching to sprintec, i never had an ovarian cyst before. after starting sprintec about 4 months ago, i wound up in the hospital 3 times for severe abdominal pain which turned out to be ovarian cysts. for everything else, this birth control is great and i have no complaints. but the cysts gotta go, so do these pills."	-10
33858	"i was switched from microgestin to junel due to the former being out-of-stock at the pharmacy that my health insurance mandates i use. two and a half weeks of constant cramping will, i'm sure, make me less than pleasant when i demand my old birth control."	-10
155310	"i'm 14 years old, and 2 weeks ago, the very next day of my homecoming i started feeling sick with pain on my right side of my stomach so the next day i go to the doctor and i get an ultrasound but they can't find my appendix. so two days later i have fever and diarrhea so i go to the hospital. in the hospital they do a ct scan which made my whole body feel warm. they then tell me that i have appendicitis and they insert many antibiotics in my iv &amp; tell me that they are going to have to drain the pus from the appendicitis by inserting a tube inside of my stomach. so when they started treating me with antibiotics to make some of the infection to go away they see a lot of improvement so they decide that they are not going to be draining."	-10
2735	"i am currently taking cartia xt 120mg once a day, and it is a mixed bag for me. i am still experiencing an elevated hr multiple times per day, and very light headed all day long. i do not feel right at all. i have also tried metropolol and lisinipril, having the best results from the latter, but it did not address my hr."	-10
71851	"after reading everyones experience with tramadol i feel better knowing it wasn't just me having withdrawals. h-codone couple days little stomach tightness no problem. tramadol real sick feeling, now been 4 days without. starting to get better no bad stomach feeling did think i was getting the flu but sounds like everyone else trying to quit had the same symptoms. i have a script waiting for me at the pharmacy and that's where its staying. wasn't much help anyway."	-10
134501	"i was in the middle of passing a kidney stone. i was admitted to the er with severe pain in right side, tremors, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, feeling of full bladder and need to urinate but inability to urinate. i was given iv toradol and the pain subsided within a minute. i was even able to get some shut eye on and off for maybe an hour. of the iv drugs i have received, this one had me the most clear headed, functional, aware. it staved off the pain for about 3-4 hours, after which i asked for another injection before being released from the er, as the pain was returning with the nausea. note: i have been having severe (2 or 3 at rest, 7-9 in wrong position) right leg pain for a few months. toradol ineffective. nerve pain?"	-10
186514	"i have been on pristiq for 4 months now due to panic attacks and anxiety and after the first 3 weeks i saw great change, but a few weeks after that it seemed like it had just stopped working so my doctor doubled my dosage. now i'm having nightmares. if i accidentally skip a dosage my head does this really weird thing and i just can't describe it. i am extremely irritable about every little thing or i'm just really happy (up and down). i have no energy most days. i just want to stay in bed and do nothing. i'm nauseated all the time. i've actually lost about 20 pounds in 4 months bringing me down to 101 pounds."	-10
225060	i've only been on it for 4 days but i refused to go back on adderall. i require 2 30mg adderall tablets a day and experience audio hallucinations after taking it for about 18 months. i have been off adderall for 15 months. i told my dr. i refuse to be back on it. i also suffer from an anxiety disorder. all of my mental health care is very well-documented from the time i was 14 years old. i am now 32 and at a place in my life where i do not want to take any stimulants to help me focus. i do take lorazepam but i'm down to 15/ 2 milligram tablets a month from 60. i seem to have energy and increased concentration with wellbutrin. adderall keeps me more focused but it's not worth the side effects. i also take 1/3mg of lunesta to sleep.	-10
80224	"this is a miracle medicine. i had a horrible cough for weeks, i started the medicine last night. it took about 30 minutes to reduce &amp; calm my coughing fits. the one thing i do not like is the ability it has to impair your thinking/judgment &quot;loopy&quot; feeling i get, then the excessiveness drowsiness. other than that, i love how it works for me!"	-10
97407	"i was diagnosed with chronic depression and my therapist suggested i start taking meds for it. i hated the thought of taking something like that so i went online and found these pills and they are amazing. i bought them from amazon. i never noticed how bad my thoughts and moods were. i couldn't be the mother my children needed me to be and some days it would be hard for me to get out the bed or even leave the house. these pills started working within the first week of taking them. i also take 5 -htp 200 mg along with the st johns wort and they work wonders together. my negative thoughts are gone and i can get up and move and smile like i use to. i would recommend these pills to anyone, especially if you would rather have a natural alternative"	-10
20181	"i was prescribed this medicine for a bladder infection and would never recommend anyone to take it. obviously it depends on your body type but i usually have a high tolerance. i'm needing to head to the doctors now because i've been experiencing painful headaches everyday, sharp stomach aches, muscle pain, chills (hot to brutally cold:fever type symptoms), tingling, light headed, nauseous, eye aches, my urine went from neon green to dark brown, and as gross as it is, i haven't been able to take a proper poo but every time i pass gas on the toilet watery diarrhea like stuff comes out and i've seen some blood when i whipped. this medicine definitely didn't go well with me and is a painful experience!"	-10
137141	"i would most definitely reccomend accutane! the stuff is brilliant!!! i am 18 and have experienced bad skin for almost 2 years, i was constantly paranoid and unhappy and now i wake up instantly in a good mood, the side effects can be quite painful as i had very dry lips and dry patches all over my arms but they are only temporary and defo worth it!"	-10
189144	"i have been on 4-5, 15 mg oxycodones a day for the last 2 yrs and i finally have my normal life back. the prior 12 yrs i was in and out of the er and hospital more than i can count, i just know in 2014, i was in and out a total of 14 times, with a gi surgery and in 2004- 2006 it was about 128 days total with a surgery. i have a very odd birth defect in my gi system. without the pain killers, i would end up in the er 1-9 days every couple of weeks with level 10+ abdominal pains that would cause uncontrollable vomiting for more than 11 days at a time. no fluids would stay down, nothing. i would be bedridden to the point the paramedics would have to come carry me out the house to the er."	-10
39058	"found this medication to be non-effective; lost a few pounds at first ; but at full dosage, the medication made me so nauseous and then ended up to be non-effective at all, didn't lose any additional weight."	-10
70684	i switched to this med because my last med put me in a horrible fog (atripla) . triumeq is working for me but it gives me pretty bad body aches especially in my lower back where my kidney area is and around my under arms. if i have an alternative i will switch. it makes me feel pretty crappy	-10
137242	"just want to say that claravis worked (40mg/2x/day). the dry lips were horrid and the first few months i hid out, but the end was totally worth it. to prevent other side effects, my doctor told me to drink 60 fl oz of electrolyte drink (i.e. gatorade, powerade, smart water). good luck!"	-10
206014	my doctor recommended this for my pre-menopausal symptoms as well as anxiety. at first i was thrilled with the results but about 3 months into it i realized the insomnia was not worth it. i have sleep apnea so this medication was not a good choice for me. my doctor increased the ambien dose and that wrecked havoc with my system. i have stopped taking both and hope to feel better soon.	-10
130512	"i had mirena placed about 4 1/2 months ago, and have had nothing but problems since! having it placed was fairly painful but not too bad. i had cramping for a few hours after and that was it. about a month after having it placed i started having terrible cramps, mood swings, low sex drive, very dry during sex, i've gained about 30 pounds since i got it. the only thing it improved is my period. my period usually lasts about 3 or 4 days and is very light, but that doesn't make up for the horrible cramps. i am having the mirena taken out this week."	-10
228602	"dr prescribed this medicine with lots of confidence, and my a1c was 8.8. sugar levels dropped, but i had a horrible time taking it. within the 3 weeks that i took it, i had woken up at least 5 times in the middle of the night with severe acidity and nausea, with constipation. felt like i would die. had to ask the doctor to stop it."	-10
53504	"i am 22 years old and in the last couple of years my skin has gone through some changes. i have oily/combo skin and acne prone. i went to the dermatologist hoping for a simple fix product as i was only trying to control small breakouts. i did not go in with terrible acne, maybe like 3 active pimples. he prescribed onexton and epiduo. told me to use epiduo at night and onexton during the day. i had to stop using epiduo after one week because it was so terribly drying it was changing my skin color. i continued onexton and my skin got so much worse. i continued using for 3 weeks and decided to stop because my breakouts were out of control. i've never had skin this bad before. switching to an all-natural routine. fingers crossed."	-10
40622	i am new to this medicine. i have been on several other muscle relaxers and they never did a thing for me. after reading what everyone else has said about this muscle relaxer i am praying it will help for me as well. i have a bulging disc in my lower back that is pinching my sciatic nerve which caused me a lot of pain in my left hip.	-10
46753	"do not take this!! worst experience of my life. made my acne 100x worse. also made my face really red and greasy. not effective at all. i have no idea why my doctor would prescribe me this. ruined my life, can't stand being seen like this. try benzoyl peroxide. much more effective. dries out your skin, but an easy fix with lotion."	-10
23712	"i used to take flexeril for back pain until i found a doctor who thinks outside the box. he prescribed this to me and it's been wonderful! no bad side effects, a little tiredness in the beginning, but other then that nothing. takes the spasms away. almost a miracle drug for me! i take 500 mg 3x a day."	-10
220134	"for a long time it seemed that everything i ate would cause my belly to swell so i looked pregnant. my constipation and belly pain also worsened significantly the last few years. after a battery of testing it was determined that i had sibo and ibs-c. after treatment with the antibiotics, my bloat was better but not gone. tried linzess for the constipation but i hated it. then doctor prescribed amitiza for constipation and amitriptine 25mg at night for bloat and pain. it has saved me. the pain is gone and the bloat is almost gone! plus, the side effects work to my advantage. don't get up to pee 4 times a night anymore and i have never slept better! dry mouth is pretty bad but i will take that over the pain, any day."	-10
152876	"coming up on 2 months on this 100 mg twice a day. take on a full stomach. it makes me throw up if i haven't eaten food with it. my skin has progressively gotten worse. i don't think it is because of the doxycycline, i think my body just wants to continue down the path of giving me acne. i am on it for moderate cystic acne and i am still getting cysts regularly and am now breaking out on my forehead where as before it was just on the jawline. not sure when this is suppose to work but i look pretty darn bad. will finish the treatment and hope for the best :("	-10
115788	"i am not very fond of depakote. when i took it it didn't improve my moodswings that much. in the beginning it made me nauseous &amp; caused my hair to fall out. no, i didn't go bald, but it thinned out my hair enough that my hairstylist noticed. eventually, my hair stopped falling out, but i gained a lot of weight &amp; i had very bad tremors &amp; bad coordination. if you do decide to take this medicine make sure your doctor tests your blood regularly. i think you are supposed to have your blood tested every 6 months."	-10
231877	"i was prescribed trazodone a few days ago for insomnia. before, i would wake up several times a night for as long as 30 to 40 minutes at a time. now i take my pill, wait about 30 minutes, go to bed and fall asleep right away, and i never wake up! i also take celexa every day which has helped my depression, but the trazodone is wonderful! i highly recommend this medicine for insomnia/sleep deprivation."	-10
176921	i suffer with depression and ptsd. my psychiatrist didn't want to prescribe zopiclone as he said it's addictive but told me to try promethazaine as said it's not addictive and i can take it every night. i found it to be very effective. i do feel quite tired in the morning but that's a small price to pay for continuous sleep. it hasn't stopped the nightmares but i'm getting to sleep quicker and staying asleep longer - definitely worth trying!	-10
3183	i have spina bifida and hydrocephalus. i have a complicated internal body structure. i have been very very tired and after reading the side effects i do believe taking nitrofurantoin is the whole cause. three days and i'm on my last day of taking the drug. i am a resident of england and was born here so i'm not insured. i am a nhs patient.	-10

177332	"i took duloxetine for 90 days. it helped reduce my pain enough that i could stop most opioids, but drug side effects were worse than the pain. i had dry mouth, then nausea which went on every day until about a month after i stopped it. i woke up in a panic sometimes, after horrible nightmares which i hadn't had before. i began teeth grinding, chipped many teeth, and was advised to have a mouth guard made. my headaches worsened markedly. my blood pressure rose substantially. i itched, sweated, and passed gas horribly. i had difficulty passing urine. my doctor had no idea how to help me; all i would be told was to &quot;drink ginger tea&quot;. stopping it was hellish, with shaking, wide blood pressure swings, and painful brain zaps."	-10
214621	"i suffered for 5 years with anxiety and depression. i tried many, many antidepressants. nothing worked. my t3 levels were very low but my tsh was only slightly high. one doctor treated me with synthroid but i had no changes. i saw many doctors including an endocrinologist that told me that nothing was wrong with my thyroid. after spending many hours online looking for answers, i found an endocrinologist that said he would try treating me with cytomel. within a day i felt amazing! it was like someone put new batteries in my body! i am finally able to be happy and live life again! truly a miracle!"	-10

168459	i'm 21 weeks pregnant and i got a year infection by antibiotics and was told by my obgyn to get monistat 7. i am on my 4th day and it burns like hell. i can't sleep my baby is moving around so much more then normal and the burning won't go away! i took a shower and have whiped down there with a cold wet soapy wash cloth. it has slowly gotten better but i am calling my doctor as soon as they open tomorrow! i will never but this brand ever again!!!!!!	-10
230767	it works! felt like a cooling sensation in my head/face. made me drowsy so i jumped into bed and slept for a couple of hours. woke up with some small migraine pain but overall reduced pain from a 10 to a 1. didn't have the chest tightening side effect that i had with sumitriptan.	-10

161884	"everyone reacts differently to medications. for me, cipro is always a fast acting antibiotic. i've only taken it a few times for severe uti's/kidney infections, and it helped tremendously within the first few days. with the amount of pain i've gotten from uti's, i'd be willing to risk the crazy side effects that some people have had. i rarely take antibiotics unless i have to. this one will treat just about anything and i've only experienced a few minor side effects like nausea, dizziness, agitation, headache, fatigue, and stomach upset. nothing too crazy."	-10
47680	"i had to stop using this product very early on because it ruined my skin. it made my skin unbelievably dry, and made me breakout on my forehead worse than it had in 5 years. i also developed red blotches all over my face. don't buy this."	-10

34679	"be attentive to your body and take note of any side effects. i've been on this for 2 weeks and had to stop because of debilitating headaches, blurry vision and neck/back pain which could have led to a worse condition. yes it was working, but it wasn't worth the side effects"	-10
107766	"i decided in 06/08 after i had my 3rd child to do something more long term, so i chose implanon. at the time of insertion i weighed 167, and now after 15 months. i have been stuck at 194. i also have have been bleeding for 15 months with an occasional 3-7 day break. i am constantly using tampons, and panty liners. my sex drive is awful, i don't even think about it. the sex drive and the bleeding is putting a damper on my marriage, and has made my husband kranky. the last 3 weeks i haven't bled. i'm hoping i have either stopped for good, or its making me a little curious if i am pregnant. i go to the doctor on the 15th and i am going to see what other options i have."	-10
16453	"i switched to this pill after my insurance changed and i could no longer afford lo loestrin. it was terrible. luckily i've previously realized the terrible mood change that some birth control pills cause for me, so when i started getting anxiety and depression after starting this one i knew i needed to quickly give it the boot. i was feeling lethargic, super high anxiety and bouts of depression. i changed over to lomedia 24 fe and have felt much better ever since."	-10
54827	"well just have start by saying so far so good. i have read other comments and was scared to start this but it is day 2 and i feel great. i had no side effects, since i told my doctor that i binge eat at night she advised to take the pill around 5 pm. 7:00 o clock came around and i had no desire to look for a snack or have a cup of coffee. i started to pack my kids lunches and didn't touch a snack which was something i always did. i had gastric bypass in 2003 starting weight was 305 got down to 165 at my lowest, which was great since i'm 5'6 and at my lowest i wore a size 6. i saw the doctor because i started gaining weight and presently are up to 216 lbs. i refuse to gain it all back. i will get write again in a week. good luck"	-10
211531	"the first day was awful... nausea, vomiting for hours, stomach ache that started about 8 hours after taking the pill (and lasted about 5 or 6 hours). i stopped it for one week cause it was xmas time and had to stay at my parents house. the second time i took it it was the same, nausea and vomit for hours. but the day after i took the pill again after dinner and the side effects disappeared, except for the over production of gas, which is still happening after two weeks. but it seems to work very fast... the ganglions are decreasing dramatically!"	-10

122127	"i have had to take this medication for years. not because i need to but because of the withdrawal symptoms. my doctor and i have been working on this for so long. my doctor even said it's too bad we didn't know then what we know now, he would have prescribed me anything but this."	-10

198065	i am a little tired and forgetful as well. those seem to be the most common side effects of metoprolol. i also take flecainide and it has some of the same side effects as metoprolol so it's hard to tell which medication is causing this. sometimes a little hard to focus but together they seem to help with the atrial fibrillation.	-10
148388	i got the mirena coil inserted against my better judgment. had it for 2 years now for heavy frequent periods. although it mostly became lighter i still get a period every 10 days which lasted 9 days. nightmare! every few months i get a very heavy bleed which lasts for 2 weeks with clotting. have asked my doctor to take it out but i kept getting told that it would settle down. last straw was when i started bleeding 3 weeks ago non stop. some days so heavy i can't leave the house. i went to doctor and demanded it be taken out. she tried and couldn't get it out. she has referred me to a gynacologist which may take a while to get an appointment. meanwhile i keep bleeding heavily. would never recommend this product.	-10

91836	"two attempts at treatment for fibromyalgia with lyrica. both had similar outcomes, in that the &quot;cure&quot; was worse than the illness. side effects were overwhelming from the onset: increased fatigue, terrifying anxiety, tremors. in addition, this drug's efficacy was zero. i received no positive effects from lyrica and discontinued use. side note: i need to learn about illnesses that affect me and medications that i take or are offered to me. doctors may mean well, but i need to know how they affect me, not just what is printed in a package insert. and if a doc is not right for me, it's time to find her replacement."	-10

192225	"this is the absolute worst birth control you could possibly take. i was on ocella for one month before i had to switch pharmacies due to my new insurance and ocella was fine. once i started on zarah, i had constant anxiety/palpitations. it got so bad to the point that i was seeing my doctor and thinking that i had a heart problem (had an echo done, normal). this birth control literally made me feel like i was going crazy and that i had all kinds of health problems. it made my left hand tingle, and i was also constantly exhausted to the point where i was almost sleeping 20 hours a day. oh and my blood pressure sky rocketed. went off this birth control and got the skyla iud. i didn't get pregnant on this bc which is literally the only good thing"	-10
62206	"i would say i have seen a complete turn around in my depression. i use 40mg of celexa and xanax proscribed three times a day if needed. i usually take two xanax before bed to fall asleep. i've been on it a year and can say its been a a blessing. didn't start that way! i chose to stick through some of the side effects and gradually increased my dosage. from 10, 20, 30 now 40 mg which i take every morning. now i feel the balance. when in need, i spoke with my doctor to increase if i was not feeling to my full potential of the medicines. still working on my anxiety around people! doing better from where i started. good luck all!"	-10

15310	"i started taking this pill around 2 years ago and started to get extremely depressed. my mom and i thought it was because of a boy i was seeing so i broke it off and also got off of the medicine, thinking i wouldn't need it anymore. about 2 months ago, i started on this same birth control again and have felt very emotionally overwhelmed and have not been myself at all. i have made the decision to go off of this medicine for good this time and already seeing positive effects. i do not at all recommend this product."	-10

159224	"i actually really like this birth control. it's doing a great job at preventing pregnancy with no alternate contraception. my only side effect has been weight gain, which no woman will be happy with..along with moodiness during my period but thats pretty typical."	-10

183359	"i suffer from major depression so the doctor gave me cymbalta. the first days i was completely out of it. didn't know what was going on so i quit taking it for a day and i went back to normal. the next day i tried again to give it time, well i have no memory of two days because i was so out of it and blacked out. i woke up in the hospital swollen up like crazy they told me i overdosed from the depression medicines but i only took 4, 1 pill a day."	-10
55566	i've been on 2x150mg pradaxa for about 1 year now after being on 14 mg of warfarin for a year before this. i had a dvt followed by a protein s deficiency diagnosis. i felt really tired/sluggish on warfarin and didn't like the inconvenience of inr testing. i feel better on pradaxa but i am considering switching back to warfarin because i don't like the idea that there is no antidote for e.r. bleeding with pradaxa. i work with saws all the time and this is a constant concern.	-10

13582	"i've been on adderall since i was in high school, so about 5 years. it works well for my concentration and allows me to focus for an extended period of time, such as when studying. this medicine has definitely helped me but it has a lot of side effects. for me, loss of appetite, euphoria, and dry mouth is the most common. headaches are frequent, but nothing ibuprofen can't fix. i've been on/off antidepressants that affected the adderall. when i was on lexapro, taking adderall would make me irritable, anxious, and paranoid. sometimes to a full blown panic attack. now i'm on prozac and the adderall combination is fine. but i still get anxious and mildly irritable when the &quot;high&quot; of the adderall decreases."	-10
130619	"i've taken the pill over 3 times in the passed 2 months. some side effects such as nausea, fatigue, stomach aches, and cramping have occurred. that's completely normal! the most recent time i have taken it was last friday. i freaked out and went to planned parenthood right away! they were super nice and said that the plan b one-step was about 79-85% effective. took it. my advice is to not psych yourself out and think about it too hard."	-10
208142	the patches kept coming off after 2 to 3 days. the backing is way to hard and not enough to peel off 2nd half without touching 1st half of patch causing that part not to adhere to skin. bayer should really consider 3m's adhesive manufacturing and backing that peels with ease and stays on until removed and in water.	-10

221528	i had my second child at 35 week. my insurance told me that the makena shot will help me not to have a premature baby the shot hurt a lot and it's burn every time i took it. i started taking it at 20 weeks pregnant i had my baby at 29 weeks my water broke early. so i believe the makena shot didn't work for me i really regret taking it it's was a waste of money for my insurance to pay for now my baby is in the nicu she's doing fine but if i ever get pregnant again i'm not taking the makena shot ever again it doesn't work	-10
179638	"this cream is very and very strong, this is perhaps what many do not realise. i don't have a very sensitive skin but i had mild acne and my doctor proscribed a daily use of it. i applied before going to bed and after there second application my face totally broke out and it looked as if i had burnt my face fighting with fire, my patches were enormous and it would itch and burn. i discontinued after the third day and saw my dermatologist who proscribed monovo to fight the side effects and skinoren to apply instead of epiduo. i wish i had read this thread before actually starting with epiduo. i had to take extra unplanned holiday because i couldn't go to work with a tomato red face."	-10
109102	"i had my nexplanon implanted 3 years ago when i was 20, which was the best decision i have ever made for my reproductive health! i've tried the pill and nuvaring but hated both methods. it's very difficult for me to follow a pill regimen, which is precisely why i switched to the nuvaring. i was relatively healthy in terms of diet and physical activity and had never experienced significant weight gain prior to the nuvaring. however, 5 months after starting the nuvaring, i gained 30 pounds, which did horrible things to my self esteem, especially as when i was a teen i struggled with an eating disorder. halfway through college, my obgyn recommended the nexplanon implant, and i've not looked back since. i'm now 23 and getting my 2nd implant in august!"	-10
105583	"i had a severe reaction to the levaquin antibiotic (levaquin toxicity) and it took 4.5-years to regain physical strength. i was working again, then my dentist prescribed methylprednisone (for numbness after dental surgery) and within 4-days i began relapsing into severe muscle weakness. i fainted multiple times driving, had temporary blindness in one eye and have had to stop working due to continued muscle weakness."	-10
69180	"i've had two bad knee surgeries and was left option-less by my orthopedist so i left and went to a pain doctor. i was prescribed celebrex after trying nearly all the other nsaids and have taken it for 6 months. i'm not painless, but it has worked miracles from where i was, and i know when i've forgotten to take it."	-10
194392	"after having unwanted side affects with two other statins, my pcp suggested trying crestor. this was about 6 years ago. since then, as he states it, i could be the poster boy for crestor. at only a 5mg/day dosage my cholesterol level has dropped from ~290 to consistently below 200 with no side affects. my only concern is there is no generic alternative and it is very expensive when the insurance companies declare that it's not in their formulary of preventive medications. i've been lucky that my pcp has been able to convince the ins co that i can't tolerate an alternative, so have not had to pay for the medication for the past several years (treated as preventative). that's changing now that i'm retired and have to go to new insurance"	-10
232015	"i have fibromyalgia and also rsd in my shoulder, which came after severe trauma to my left side and hip which was fractured also. rsd is a frustrating disorder. but trazadone has really helped my sleep and makes me feel rested and i sleep for 8 hours or so usually. i take sometimes up to 10mg of lorazepam depending on which doctor prescribes it and i take this everyday for severe anxiety and panic attacks and it helps with the pain i have all over my body too. but lorazepam can't put me to sleep in the hospital they gave me 14mg everyday of my 30 day stay and it just made me hyper. so i believe benzodiazepines and things like ambien, lunesta, and imovane are not necessary. trazadone helps you sleep much better and is not addictive."	-10
46324	"i am 29 yrs old, female, and have chronic fatigue due to depression and rheumatoid arthritis. this drug seemed like the perfect cure but it gave me pretty unwanted side effects including worsening of depression, panicky, dizziness, blurred vision, headaches, worsening of fatigue, dazzed, would have words on the tip of my tongue sometimes that would take like 30 sec to remember what i wanted to say, and muscle tension, extreme anger at people and myself, and increased joint pain. so the 2 hours it'd actually increase my energy, all these side effects are not worth it."	-10
15026	"this is awful! never felt this bad! bloating, mood swings, boobs hurt, feel fat all the time and i don't know how long i'm gonna have my period! i don't think it's gonna ever end and sex is completely out of the question! i feel like a crazy person! mad at the world and can't stand myself! i'm only on my first week second month in!"	-10
229995	"initially i really liked this medication. much less initial sting after application than the drops i used before. however, after about two weeks of use, i had an allergic reaction that caused my eyes to appear as if i had conjunctivitis. didn't realize it was the lastacaft and went to the doctor for anti-biotic drops. after my eyes cleared up in two or three days, i again applied lastacaft and immediately looked like my eyeballs were bleeding. my vision got blurry and my eyes were very sensitive to light. i am one of the &lt;4% with an allergic reaction."	-10
122989	"i switched from another pill to this one because of side effects of the other pill. this pill regulated my moods, and increased my chest size and sex drive. however, i gained 12lbs in less than 6 months and was unable to lose it despite diet and exercise. it also gave me dangerously high blood pressure which went back down when i switched off of it. so if you are worried about weight gain and blood pressure this isn't the pill for you. periods were also heavier than on the previous pill i was on."	-10
74482	"i used this birth control several times. i have tried others, the shot, alesse, etc. but in comparison, 777 is my favorite. my periods were shorter, lighter, minimal to no cramping, no weight gain, no crazy mood changes, and the birth control was stable, no spotting. it was great. i am going to talk to my doctor about getting back on it. i only stopped to try for one more baby, but am so over that idea."	-10
39618	"soon after beginning contrave i began to feel really wonky, couldn't sleep no matter how i tried. as much as i wanted to quit, i gave it 6 weeks anyway. like many medications, thought the side effects would pass. they didn't. i titrated off as my doctor recommended. a month and a half later, i no longer feel wonky, but still only getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night. my son in law has been on it a year, working hard to change his life. but even as active as he is, surfer, runner, skateboarding, he's lost a whole 12 pounds. just not worth it."	-10
40332	"i tried savella for about 2 days. i had severe nausea, rapid heartbeat, and horrible hot flashes. it also ran my blood pressure up. started with a 12.5, then the next day broke the 12.5 in half and still had the same side effects. i have tried everything from neurontin to antidepressants and i have bad side effects from them all. so as of now all i'm taking is tramadol as needed. i give up on all the other medicines."	-10
23602	"i am 19 years old. i was diagnosed with rrms at the age of 15, in 2012. i started out on rebif injections. i was on that for 6 months and had to stop due to anaphylactic shock. i had 3-4 flares and had to be treated by steroids. after, i started copaxone and had 3-4 flares that caused a lot of damaged. i took this medication for 6 months and went into anaphylactic. in june, i started tysabri. it took 6 months of fighting with my insurance to cover it. in the time being, i tested positive for jc virus. i had my 6th infusion nov. 10, 2016. i can't emphasize and exaggerate enough how terrible i feel. i can barely move. i have severe chest pain and tightness. i'm so fatigued, i can't stay awake for more then a couple hours. i hate it."	-10

129086	"i discontinued birth control several months ago after taking it for 18 years and in a moment of passion my husband and i flat out forgot that i wasn't protected and took no precautions. we realized our mistake after it was too late. it was day 15 of my cycle and the next morning i could tell i was ovulating. i bought plan b and expected to feel very sick. i just prayed i wouldn't throw up during the first two hours. even normal bc pills make me vomit when starting a new pack. i was shocked when i felt totally fine, other than some dizziness. i even did some yoga (and felt like amy schumer). it's too soon to confirm that it worked but my experience has been good so far and i have a good feeling about it"	-10
229292	"love it , finally felt normal or what i think it means , only problem i have is the restless legs its much worse now that its been increased to 80mg , but i was fine on 60mg , my solution is to sponge my legs with cool water as it happens at night , helps a bit . otherwise its the magic bullet for me."	-10
195295	ulcers in stomach. unbelievable pain in gut...but it made my toothache go away lol	-10
80048	"took this and had the worst 4 hours of non stop dry cough, no relief. finally took robitussin again and stayed with that and tylenol to get some sleep. was really hoping for sleep relief when i came back from dr. but this was not it."	-10
93037	"i was switched to trintellix after several other ssri medications didn't seem to work. i was started on 10mg, the first week i felt fine. but then its as if overnight i became a different person. i went straight into a mania phase. i wasn't sleeping, eating. i felt like i had no control of my emotions or my body. it almost cost me my marriage. thankfully, my husband knew me well enough to know this was not normal for me and had me go back to my pcp and now i'm back on zoloft and waiting to get in with a psychiatrist to find some other options. i don't want to experience anything like that again."	-10
14306	i'm 20 years old and have had issues with my bladder for about a year now. this is the first medication i've taken and it has done nothing for me. didn't get any side effects but didn't see any improvement in my frequency or urgency. complete dud.	-10
158115	"i'm going to start this off by saying that i was a completely different person before i started taking this medication. i was prescribed this medication when i was 12 years old, suffering from anorexia, severe depression, and anxiety. this medicine gave me horrible side effects-- trouble with speech, socializing, and i became so dependent on this medicine every night that it took me 3 months of no sleep or food, having to miss school and be locked inside all day, to finally ween off it. i feel like this medicine definitely 'fried' my brain, before taking this medicine i had no issues with motivation, attention, socializing, and speech. after about 4 years off this medication, i can say i'm finally starting to feel a bit bit better."	-10
122173	"it worked for about a year and then the panic and anxiety came back. even being weaned off of the drug i had the most horrible side effects, mood swings, 40lb weight gain in only one month to name just a few. i have been off of it now for about 6 months and still experience the brain jolts."	-10
162842	my doctor prescribed for sinusitis. after finishing the first round i was still having problems and called the doctor. he called in another round of the same prescription which i finished a week ago. still having the same problem and called today. he called in omnicef again and i am not sure if i will even pick it up. i take the full prescription as prescribed.	-10
8315	i have used it on and off for years. it works so fast. get in bed then spray it. downside is that it tastes really bad but the taste is gone if you drink water afterwards. it also is very useful for traveling and plane rides that are over 4 hrs. it is approved if you only can get 4 hours of sleep. so sometimes when i fly i will spray this and sleep for my 5.5hr plane ride.	-10
33877	didn't like this pill at all!! made my anxiety and depression increase a lot. i was sad and emotional all the time. only on it for 1 month and i couldn't take it any longer so my doctor recommended i switch. thank god i did!	-10
163090	firstly yes it worked however after my experience i think this pill should be illegal! it messed me up and i now regret taking it. it said on the leaflet your next period may be a few days late and if any longer than 7 to do a pregnancy test) i did not get my period so i did tests.. all negative.. 3 months later.. finally got a period and the pain was just horrific. i will never take a pill like this again. horrible horrible thing!	-10
188790	i was recently prescribed vascepa for high triglycerides. i have been highly impressed with it's ability to stop inflammation and pain from my multiple sclerosis. i am eagerly waiting to see how well vascepa lowers my triglycerides at tje next visit doctor visit.. this medicine is great and minus the issues associated with dha. meaning no a-fib or palpitations and tachycardia. as pure as pure is and well well worth the money! vascepa is a wonder drug. thank you amarin pharmaceuticals.	-10

183226	"i started on cymbalta 30 mg and it improved my mood so my prescriber increased to 60 mg. 60 mg caused increased irritability and negative thinking so i decided to taper off. this caused flu-like symptoms and &quot;the shakes&quot; so started researching cymbalta withdrawal. surprisingly, a lot of people have similar symptoms when coming off cymbalta. the only way to avoid it is to open the capsules and divide the pellets to take a gradually reduced dose over several weeks. my prescriber suggested returning to 30 mg to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms and i have stayed there for the past 2 months. i am back to experiencing positive effects - i feel like i am coming out of a fog i didn't realize had been surrounding me for years."	-10
150542	"my experience was horrible!!!!!! perscribed 2 pills a day for 3 days. after the last pill, i started feeling strange and had servere headaches from the time i started taking it until a week later. i didn't think much of it until i went home from work and didn't leave the couch. i had no appetite, constipated, sweating and chills, i wanted to puke, my eyes hurt so bad. couldn't shake whatever was going on and drank as much water as possible. my body was sore i slept almost an entire weekend away. i can't tell if my uti is completely gone or not because i'm still constipated and it hurts! i've never had an antibiotic like this and i never want it again! all my doc told me was to keep pushing fluids and eat yogurt. good luck people."	-10
69550	"i have found this medication to be very successful for me. i started on the 20 mcg/hr patch because of post op nerve pain continually wakening me throughout the night (with all the results a lack of sleep has on you both physically and mentally). through the use of the patches, i have been able to finally sleep the night through and reduce other medicines (lortab/flexiril/klonipin) and stop one other completely. it is a low enough dose that doesn't make you all loopy while still strong enough to have a long term effect on my arch nemesis and yours, pain. even if my insurance didn't pay for it, it is the one medicine i would still purchase out of pocket."	-10
60545	"has caused chronic pain, muscle cramps, loss of muscle."	-10
56759	"i have had migraines my entire adult life. when i got the most recent pain, the doctors were quick to call it a migraine. i felt like my head would explode, and i had none of the other side effects attributed to migraines. my doctor instead now calls it &quot;severe head pain&quot;. i had it every other day for about a month. i actually called &quot;911&quot; at one point because i thought i was dying the pain was so horrible. when i was first given elavil i was skeptical since it was touted as an &quot;anit-depressant&quot;. i took it, and the first three days i actually had to take naps because it made me so sleepy. on the fourth day i realized that although i still felt a little sleepy, i was now officially four days head pain free. it has been a godsend."	-10
172702	"my rheumatologist feels that this medication allows me to sleep without extreme night time pain. if i do not get sleep, i am unable to function during the day. this medicine allows me to sleep without pain causing tears every time i turn over. sorry, i have had none of the side affects except for the ability to sleep for 8 hours---the reason i agreed to take this medication. quality of life trumps pain and the chance that i will have any of these side effects."	-10
63485	"awful. doesn't work made all my skin dry and flakey i was so itchy after using it and my whole face turned bright red even water stung my face, my face is swollen and too sore to even touch, my face and back are itchy constantly all day, wouldn't bother using this product"	-10
170805	"i have been taking seroquel xr consistently for almost a year. i recently decided to try to lower my dose from 200mg/night to 100mg/night because i'm fed up with the weight gain (diet/exercise don't seem to do much to combat it), but i began to feel unstable a few days after lowering the dose. on seroquel xr i am content, even-tempered, not very anxious, no paranoia, no self-harm thoughts, but when i mess with the dosage or stop it entirely i quickly remember why i take it. i instantly begin to assume that others don't care about me, to feel lonely, impulsive, and very down for no reason. i'm hoping to switch to a medication with a similar mechanism as seroquel xr without the weight gain...(geodon...?)"	-10
168629	"had bad side effects when i started taking this drug. the side effects went away after a week, but this drug did nothing for my anxiety. in fact a few days after my doctor switched me to this med my anxiety was worse than it ever was, i felt as if i was going to crawl out of my skin. doctor switched me back to lexapro and i seem to be doing better."	-10
78483	"i went into labor at 24 weeks with my first child and she was born at 27 weeks. i started taking makena when i was 16 weeks pregnant with my second child. my last injection was at 36 weeks and i thought for sure he would be born soon after because of my history. he was 3 days overdue, and probably would have stayed put a few days longer if my doctor hadn't broke my water. i'm currently taking makena again for my third child and am 31 weeks. braxton hicks seem intense this time around, but i'm still confident i've got some time left... and we've already made it a month longer than my first :)"	-10

30548	"i'm 20 and this is my first yi, and was told by my mom to go ahead and get this product, that is had fantastic reviews. however, now as i lay in bed itching like crazy, i'm reading reviews and i see i'm not the only one with this issue. i've been itching for a few days so i told my mom and went to the store to get some monistat 7-day. this is the first night of use and i was excited to get this fixed. however, this itching is unbearable. i couldn't fall asleep and i've woken up at 4 am because of the insane itching. the only slight relief i can get is laying on my back. i want to rinse this cream out so bad, but if it gets rid of this yi, i'll deal with the horrific itchiness. please, anyone reading this, avoid this product."	-10
208059	"1st prep was at 4:00 pm. it was not as bad as the reviews that i have read on the internet. i mixed the solution with ice cold water, put a lemon under my nose, held my nose throughout the entire drink + 5mins, use a straw placed all the way to the back of your throat! put on some good motivational music &quot;blarring&quot; through the house :) and had at it. within 10 minutes i had already drank the solution and downed the 1st 16oz chaser. in between drinking the prep i would stop and suck on a lemon or a small sip of water. drink the prep as fast as possible but don't make yourself sick. it took only 15 minutes for the solution to work. make your bathroom your mini office...(laptop, baby wipes, water chasers with you!, etc..)"	-10
180387	"for 5 years, my knee has caused severe problems and i have had to use a brace or bandage when on my feet. after having a large mass removed from my leg, the knee got worse and was swollen until i couldn't walk without a cane or walker. i went to the doctor to see if i could get a shot to help me walk and he gave me a tube of voltaran gel to use. i came home, put it on the knee and propped my leg up for an hour. when i was ready to get up, i dreaded it because i just knew i was going to be in horrible pain again. but, the pain was almost all gone. i couldn't believe that a simple gel could have that effect so fast but, it did! this product is worth its weight in gold! no cane for two days now!"	-10

140262	"definitely ask for the black cherry flavor! i have been taking this since september and my dose was recently increased to 20 mg. i really love saphris! it can work on any symptom you have. depression. mania. psychosis. anxiety. you may even be able to get samples from your doctor since it is so new. if you take it all at night like i do, make sure you get 7-8 hours sleep. 6 will not do!"	-10
131742	i don't normally review anything but this time i thought i thought i should especially considering most people only tell you the negative experiences of a drug. i really didn't know my anxiety was bad until now. i know i had bad &quot;nerves&quot; is what i call it and i'm normally on edge and get paranoid about almost everything especially my relationships. i got so used to being anxious that it became normal to the point that i forgot what the other side felt like. strange but true statement. effexor has allowed me to handle just about anything thrown at me. yes i get a little anxious but over all i'm ok. i did have bad gas and a headache but it got better totally worth a try.	-10
125626	was prescribed this by my ob for a mild case of bv. took one pill on a full stomach. it tasted awful and i immediately threw up everything i had eaten. then i read the paperwork from the pharmacy and it said to ask your dr if you're less than 12 weeks pregnant... i just hit 8 weeks today. should i trust the dr or just say no to flagyl?	-10
3379	i took this for my uti it has worked on me but nitrofurantoin makes me pee a lot it also made me dizzy for the first couple of day but got through it.	-10
105972	"well...... it worked. that's about all i can say.you'll be able to focus, and if you don't mind the fact that the only thing you'll be able to focus on is how tired, nauseated, and occasionally slightly mad you feel, this is the medicine for you. despite that, it's worth nothing that i'm only 17 and ~130 pounds which is really close to the minimum weight on the box. based on what i've seen, it seems to work better for ~30 year olds who aren't underweight. not a professional, obviously, though, so take this with a grain of salt."	-10
112562	"i took 3mg my first night. i was so groggy, i don't remember anything from about two hours before bed and i had the worst time waking up this am. i was so groggy and cranky and again can barely remember anything until i started finally getting up and around. this is super strong, i took 3mg, but for someone who goes days without sleeping, i'll take these side effects over no sleep any day. i am taking the generic. at least give it a try. i have to for insurance purposes and i'm pretty glad i did. my doctor says the grogginess will fade after a while."	-10
67437	"i have always had amenorrhea (irregular periods) my whole life. recently at 21, i discovered that i have pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome) by testing that was done. i am starting to take metformin to help it. i have to have provera prescribed every 3 months, for prevention of endometrial cancer. i have depression and pmdd, which is a severe form of pms, so the only downside is that it makes me extremely depressed for when i do have my period. but it always makes me have my period by the third, fourth, or recently fifth day. it does what it is supposed to do though, and that is good."	-10
222680	used it for a mth and having the weirdest seizures ever	-10
194789	"when i take my dose it makes me more sleepy than usual. it's not everyday, but some days i can be sleepy after 7-9 hours when i have slept enough (approx. 7-8 hours). that's the only side effect i had up to now. so i am ok with it, i guess. annoying with two tablets 500 mg each day, but oh well better than seizures. that's even worse. those who had them can feel with me. :)"	-10
199174	"do not get this shot! it tried to ruin my life. heavy sporadic bleeding, mood swings, depression, headaches, body aches, no sex drive, terrible cramps, i have little/no emotion for almost everything. i only had 2 shots. i just want to get back to my normal :("	-10
231810	"this medicine helped me sleep. i felt tired most of the morning hours. i've tried varying doses. now i'm trying to get off of it. i'm taking 5 htp, which seems to help me. but it didn't do anything for my fibromyalgia."	-10
141173	"i have been taking lexapro for 5 weeks now. in the first two weeks i thought it was having a positive affect on my moods, anxiety and depression. however, in the last 3 weeks, i seem to have reverted back and may have even regressed further back before i even started taking the drug. i have had more suicidal thoughts, desire to be left alone, high anxieties, extreme mood swings, and no motivation. i feel alone, with no hope. i have less interest in things i enjoy now than i did before taking lexapro. my doctor told me that it would take 4-6 weeks for the medication to realize it's full effect/potential. entering my 6th week, it's time for me and my doctor to consider alternatives."	-10
108464	"i just began contrave on friday march 20th. since then i have not had any significant side effects. a little jittery at times but i also drink a lot of coffee so that could be causing the jitters. i've been sleeping great, just as before i started the medication. i haven't had any more cravings but i am still getting hungry around meal times. i'm being more cautious of what i'm eating and am also keeping a food journal in combination of a med journal...logging how i felt on that day and such. in the four days i've been on it i have lost 4 pounds! i'm pretty excited about. still on just taking one pill in the morning. will start taking my evening pill this friday. so far, so good!"	-10
6498	i was started on 75mg at first and for 2 weeks i had the worst side effects. i literally thought i was going insane. the doctor told me it was normal and ride it out another week. so i did and it passed. they moved me to 150mg xl and it worked wonderful for years. a few years in i had to go up to 300 xl but i was still panic free and depression free. until recently when it stopped working and i had prozac added to the mix. i would recommend welbutrin xl to people. just know you can push through those awful side effects for a few weeks to feel better.	-10
13500	"for me, adderall is a dream and a nightmare all wrapped in one pill. when i wake up i need the adderall just to be productive in my day, it works like a charm and makes me more creative and motivated. but i find that i need more and more to keep going. eventually when the day is over and its too late to take any more pills, i feel zoned out and unable to sleep. if adderral came with a powerful sleep medicine, it would be a perfect drug. although i don't like the anti-social aspect that comes with it. you get so concentrated that you become socially awkward and don't want to talk with anybody. also when i drink on adderall i can become crazy aggressive at times. but other than that i love adderall, i've done some of my best work on it."	-10
8021	"they are a huge help, i have post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and agoraphobia and if i didn't have xanax don't think i could go out of the house. i also have seizures and take topamax. everything got worse when my libido passed! now i can do the things i used to do!"	-10
149383	"i had mirena inserted in february while i was on my cycle. the insertion wasn't killer, the pain came after when i was leaving the doc. felt like pulling over &amp; crying. the next day was all good. i bleed through april. it stopped for about 3 weeks &amp; now the bleeding is back with a vengeance. i'm bleeding like crazy. i hope it quits soon."	-10
29051	"i've been on 50 mg of brand topamax for two years and the cognitive impairment is significant. i often forget how to spell my last name, i don't remember events of just yesterday, and i can't spell anything anymore for the life of me. i take it for rapid cycling bipolar i &amp; went off it for two weeks to attempt to get my cognition back - by about the 6th day i started to show signs of mania and by day 8 i was full blown manic with psychosis. i'd do anything to get off this brain mush of a drug but it serves a purpose. oddly, i never went into psychosis until this drug. oh, and the days that passed without topamax lead to the worst headaches ever. buyer beware."	-10
169637	"migraines, being on both sides of my family, began for me as a child. my aunt gave me 2 fiorinal tablets in 1970 when i was seventeen as i suffered one of the worst migraines i'd ever had. the pain was gone within 35 minutes. now i would take two, relax, and wait until the pain subsided. as the migraine sufferers in our family have gotten older, the migraines have grown with us all both in frequency and intensity. when mine did the same, even if it was for days. i took my fiorinal tablets as prescribed and needed. i absolutely guarantee that fiorinal was totally responsible for keeping me functional even through the pain."	-10
26733	"i have been using this birth control for a year, and it hasn't given me any problems since the first month i used it. as long as i take it consistently, i have no problems. my cramps and mood swings are much better, and i only experienced cramping between periods for the first 2-3 months. everyone is different, but as far as this one goes, it works very well with my body!"	-10
87414	once it was introduced into my pump my legs felt as though they were on fire this was corrected with bynedryel. the following effects were an intolerance to light that caused migraines also the lack of bowel control and the loss of hearing in my right ear and visual problems that left me unable to drive.i had to go to my doctor and insist that the prialt be removed. he resisted but i prevailed. i have never been that sick with multiple illnesses in my life. i have had 3 spinal bone fusions and 2 thumb reconstructions with right and left shoulder operations also a right knee operation and countless spinal injections and on and on. because of my doctors reluctance to extract the prialt. i called the manufacturer of prialt who stopped it instantly.	-10

62572	"citalopram has given me my life back. i was nervous, panicky, overwhelmed by thoughts, feeling vulnerable, at times even agrophobic and like i couldn't cope. now i would describe myself as fairly confident, happy and self-assured. i still have some bad days but generally citalopram has made all the difference. i have also had therapy and joined classes such as confidence building and positivity. these classes have also made a significant difference to me. no real side effects from citalopram either, except dry mouth and feeling thirsty - which really isn't a problem."	-10
141005	"i started taking this after celexa stopped working for me (from celexa to lexapro). i noticed the results immediately. ssris work incredibly fast for me, within hours. i have no sexual dysfunction like with some other ssris. i started from 10mg to balance the 20mg of celexa since they are the same. i then went to 20mg of lexapro. i have been spaced out since. i think that i get more frequent depersonalization. it does help with my anxiety levels most of the time. however, it doesn't really effect my ocd. i just got put on 30 mg, which i started today and am skeptical about it. i don't want to feel like a zombie all day, or wake up everyday with horrible depersonalization. overall it is okay for reducing anxiety."	-10
220621	"loestrin 24 is definitely the best form of birth control out there. i have been taking it non stop for the last 6 years and i've never had a single problem while taking it. i always take it at the same time every single day and if by chance i miss a day, my periods were never longer. i had a little bit of acne before i started taking the pill and it definitely cleared it up for me. about weight gain, i never gained a pound except in my breasts. if anything, the pill actually allowed me to lose weight. the only negative thing i have to say about loestrin 24 is that it tends to be a little pricey but if you have insurance, it's definitely the best pill out there! i will never switch from this pill! very satisfied!"	-10
210963	"prescribed mirtazine 10mg for depression &amp; insomnia. not a good sleeper at the best of times. 1st night slept ok, well better than i had. maybe just a couple of hrs but any sleeps better than none. since then, the odd night a bit of sleep but nothing significant. don't really feel any benefit as of yet but only been on it for a wk &amp; half. keeping fingers xd it starts to lift my mood &amp; kicks in to help me sleep better. thinking of taking valerion or kalms alongside it. hoping this is ok"	-10
9174	i think this was the worst pill i could have ever tooken. it caused my periods to stop completely and also my sex drive was gone. cause issue with me and my husband and also caused hair loss!!!! yes i'm 25 years old and my hair is falling out!!!! i'm talking about my hair is falling out in chunks! not like one or two strands - no i can't even brush my hair anymore!	-10
212545	a new study about genital herpes transmission has recently been published. we are not quite sure whether it can help find a cure for herpes but it does show some interesting perspective. bacteria in vagina can affect genital herpes transmission the study suggests that healthy vaginal microflora may protect women from getting infected with genital herpes. the study has been led by a doctoral student at the university of texas medical the experiment that was carried out in the laboratory compared various cultures that normally live in the vagina. researchers found that the herpes simplex virus type-2 (genital herpes) replicated more in cultures that contained less lactobacillus (were less healthy).	-10
2832	"i've been on multiple different pain meds for chronic spine issues. the pain dr decided to switch me to this new pain medicine with promising results. this is my 3rd dose and stomach pain and nausea begin 45 min after every single dose. it seems to subside a little towards the 8th hour or so. this medicine has 0 effect on pain just creates more by adding the stomach pain. this medicine is being pushed because it has a low potential for abuse thanx to the junkies.that's fine but make sure it works before u release it. all of the complaints about this drug will make it a short lived one. doctors will push it hard in the beginning but patients will push back. complete garbage , and a waste of money, thanks endo pharm, for the stomach pain"	-10

169363	i have been on this medication a month and i have lost 11 lbs. with the appropriate diet and exercise this medication is wonderful. at first it did give me the gitters and a mild headache but after a few days its just fine. it controls my appetite and i have to remind myself to eat alot of the time. i also take topamax at night time as part of my weight lost plan. i highly recommend this medication.	-10

36093	"long story short. imiquimod is the best thing that ever happened to me! it got rid of my unsightly nasty genital warts and boosts my immune system to fight them always. i felt strange my first use, my heart beats fast, head hurts, areas of my genitals swelled up and caused warts on other areas. when that happens your viral load is high! now i look down there and my confidence is back all thanks to this special drug. i wish some people will stop downing it. without imiquimod there would be no help for my condition"	-10

125530	"after reading a large number of shocking reviews from people talking dulcolax, i went to sleep extremely nervous after taking 1 pill at 11pm. i drunk a 500ml bottle of water immediately after taking the tablet. i did not wake once in the night, and finally woke at around half 7am where i experienced some mild cramping. this was expected after reading reviews however in my head i was preparing for the worst to come, but it never did. 15 minutes of cramping passed, i made my way to the bathroom where a normal bowel motion occurred, and now i feel much better with no lasting side effects. overall, a good product however i strongly recommend drinking water after taking dulcolax."	-10
126238	my husband has been taking this for depression and anxiety for little over 3 weeks now...up to 40 mg. the only negative is the diarrhea and nausea. this is extreme at the present. the good thing is that he does feel better mentally and there is no sexual side effects (as it was with zoloft). i am hoping the negative side effects go away soon.	-10
81326	"i was on yas a few years ago and i stopped. i had no problems with it and it did clear up my acne, which was mild anyway. when i started it up again, there are two things i don't like about it: 1. normally my periods are very heavy on day two and taper off at a five, they also pushed back every month by about a week. with yaz, my periods are much lighter to the point where i'm only spotting but then i'm spotting for almost a week and a half and even though i'm on the blanks, my period does not start now until almost the second week of my new pack. 2. my breasts are extremely tender all.month.long! at first, i didn't mind because my breasts grew by almost a full cup. i can hardly hug people! i don't know if i'll continue or at least take a break."	-10

218894	"i have been bipolar for 20 years and have tried many medicines, with depakote and lithium being the worst. i also needed antidepressants too. i went from 117 lbs to 225 lbs in 2 years on depakote and being a zombie i did not notice the huge weight gain. i switched to lamictal and effexor and felt so much better. i started a daily exercise program and was able to cut down on food and lost over 100 lbs within 2 years."	-10

52305	"i have used this pill off and on for the past 9 years. i have to say it's the best pill for losing weight and the only thing that has ever worked for me. i gain at least 60-70 pounds with each pregnancy, so each time i have a child, i have a massive amount of weight to lose, and each time i take the pill, i go right back down to my size 4 within 4-5 months ( no exercise). my tips, after taking it so long are the following: always take way before breakfast--take the first thing in the morning, and if you really want to get results, don't eat any carbs for breakfast. never go from taking one a day to stopping, because you will gain it back. you must wean yourself off slowly and you'll be fine."	-10

151263	"here is what nicotine does to your brain... nicotine also can have effects on the parts of the brain that sense pleasure. when nicotine gets into the brain, it is able to stimulate the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. dopamine activates some of the neurons in the part of the brain that register pleasure. as a result, nicotine triggers a chemical sensation of pleasure, which causes people to associate tobacco use with a feeling of pleasure. here is what chantix does to it... chantix messes with the part of the brain that senses pleasure, looks forward to things, has hope for tomorrow. it takes that all away. i took chantix and the effects were catastrophic. needed three meds to counter it. stay away!"	-10

176796	"i have been on nardil for 30 years because of depression, panic attacks and severe anxiety. i did gain weight while taking nardil, but after 6 months after i started nardil, i began to have good days again. for me, nardil took a long time to begin working to ease my depression, etc. i also take one, 5 mg of valium. i am a senior citizen and at times it does concern me about continuing the nardil, but as long as it keeps working and i see my psychiatrist regularly, i have faith i will be okay. sure, i have a few &quot;down&quot; days here and there, but never like it was before i was put on nardil long ago. (i had taken other &quot;older&quot; antidepressants...none of them worked until the nardil was prescribed). a side effect i have is intense sweating."	-10

166086	"i decided to write a review if this works. my boyfriend and i had sex when the condom broke. we freaked out since i had been skipping my birth control pill (which is a bad idea...take your bc) and i was also starting to ovulate. we ran out to get the pill asap and i took it probably 2-3 hours after the incident. i recommend taking it asap because it'll be more effective. i didn't really have any side effects except i was pretty fatigued a lot. a few days ago, i had cramps and broke out with acne and today i got my period. the pill works if you take it as soon as possible and if you haven't ovulated by the time you take it. if you ovulate, wait a day after unprotected sex, then take it. it's not gonna work because you're already pregnant."	-10
227566	"i have been on the implanon for almost two years, i'm getting it replaced and putting in a new one sometime in january. i absolutely love it, i don't get my period for months at a time, my longest one was two months. when i do get it, it is the same i've always bled in the beginning of it, and after the first week or so it's nothing but a light bleeding if hardly any at all. i would recommend it, but you also have to take into consideration that any birth control affects people differently depending on how your body reacts to it. i love it, and have gotten scared about pregnancy since i had my daughter in march of 2010, but that's only from not getting it for months at a time. i haven't gotten pregnant when i should have. i love it."	-10

194251	"i experienced several side effects, including vision change, hoarseness, insomnia, terrible dry mouth, headaches (migraine) to name a few, but my blood pressure did go to normal. i had to try something else."	-10
182526	"had my mirena inserted about 2 weeks ago. i am 22 and haven't had any kids, i wanted an alternative to the pill as i've been on it for 6 years. i have to say that i was pretty nervous after reading so many bad comments. i was on the 3rd day of my period and for me the insertion hurt like a couple of pinches and a really bad cramp that gave me all hot and made me nauseous. but it only took about 10 minutes and then it was okay. the rest of the day i had fairly strong cramps but nothing unbearable. the next day i felt back to normal. my period lasted another couple of days and stopped like normal. since then i have had very minor spotting with an odd little cramp here and there. very happy so far."	-10
175035	"started using gilenya and felt better after a weeks time. however, i constantly felt dehydrated and my skin looked dried out even with consuming much water. i was urinating a dark color and after taking blood test a month into treatment my liver levels were high. i continued treatments for another month and a half but my liver levels continued to increase so i stopped my prescription. i will say i was feeling better with less mood swings and my spirits felt lifted and the lesions were reduced and minimal."	-10
28511	"gained about forty pounds, became more depressed, slept all night and half the day, was always tired, getting off of it was horrible. i had headaches weird feelings like i wasn't even there, weird pains."	-10
94159	"like many, many others, i've tried them all. most of the recent ad's (viibryd, etc) have been pretty mediocre, but i found myself doing at least as well on brintellix as the first time i started zoloft (my reference for a good antidepressants). i didn't really experience any side effects and eventually titrated up to 20mg per day. after almost a year at this dose, i still haven't experienced any side effects, find that my sexual response is uninhibited, and there has been no poop-out. compared to all the others, i think brintellix is the best i've tried yet. the reason i don't rate it 10 is that while it has been more effective than other meds, i still feel there is quite a room for improvement."	-10
121536	i just started about two weeks ago. i completely see a difference in myself for the better. my children are even noticing the difference in my reactions to basic things. i won't say i don't feel anything..but this is a period in my life...feeling nothing is what i need. i am able react to situations with logic. instead of being on the emotional roller coaster all the time! i was suicidal two weeks ago. i took my kids zip-lining yesterday. i needed this. i'll deal with the withdraws later..this medication saved my life. i work out 4days a week so no energy loss. i don't feel a change in my appetite yet. i did have headaches yesterday briefly. dreams.. falling dream a few times. no weight gain so far. sex. i don't have a desire yet.	-10
169413	"i've been taking tenuate for a few days. when i take it in the morning, i start to feel sweaty and shaky about 45 minutes later, but if i eat half a bowl of cereal and put my hair in a ponytail, then i am fine. the rest of the day when i take it, it does curb my appetite, but i still get hungry and i still like the taste of my favorite foods so i'll continue to eat after i'm full. i hope to see a difference soon. maybe its due to my hypoglycemia. i get really shaky anyway if i don't eat on time."	-10
38209	first time i experienced a heart arrhythmia was following its use and stopped taking using medicine.	-10
93051	"if i could give this drug a zero, i would! doc started me on 5 mg and i took one pill, with a small snack, right before bed. the next day i had nausea so incredibly bad, i couldn't move or function! i was dry-heaving all day, had no appetite, and twice, got very clammy and felt like i was going to pass out. if those problems weren't enough, during the evening, i had the most painful headache i've ever had in my life! it also made me feel anxious and irritable. i decided to never take this drug again and am still severely nauseous, and incredibly fatigued, two days later!"	-10
150827	i've been on it for 6 days now and i feel the same as i did before. this is my first time taking it for a sinus infection. i guess it doesn't work for me.	-10
16110	"it's only been a month. i have anxiety as it is, this birth control made it 100x worse. the last couple of weeks i haven't been sleeping because i've been up with anxious feelings and had panic attacks for no reason. i haven't been feeling myself at all, i feel depressed. i didn't really experience mood swings, but my anxiety was so much worse. i just finished my period and it's safe to say that i will not start my new pack next week."	-10
132999	i started taking lo loestrin fe about 2 months ago and i am breaking out horribly around my mouth and chin. i have always had acne but not that severe and it actually cleared up in the past year with the occasional pimple here and there....now i have cysts and white heads all over my chin that are not going away. i am finishing this pack and then calling my doctor to switch.	-10
187823	i was prescribed dexamethasone 4mg twice daily for altitude illness as i was working above 12500 feet above sea level. within 2 hours of taking 4 mg i was no longer short of breath. i will gradually reduce the amount over seven days as i return to a lower altitude 10000 feet above sea level. this program has kept met alerted as to possible side effects which i will watch for. it has made this trip a blessing.	-10
30113	"i suffer from tinnitus, which causes me great anxiety. my doctor put me on klonopin 3 times a day 0.5 mg along with ambien and celexa once a day. i feel so much better. i am able to ignore the noise, and when i do hear it...it don't go into panic mode. i am sleeping better than ever."	-10
229144	"this medicine is good for me and has boosted my confidence as previously i couldn't sustain an erection for long enough to please my partner or even to orgasm sometimes. i take the lowest dosage available but i can now achieve a long lasting rock hard erection when aroused, leading to a powerful ejaculation. my partner is also highly satisfied with the changes in me. the side effects of a blocked nose and headache are irritating but mild and disappear after a day or so."	-10
48314	"i was diagnosed with stage 4 nsclc , in oct. 2014 it had metastasized into my right humerous, after radiation and chemo the cancer went into remission, so i was put on tarceva 150 it's been typical side effects, face rash ,diarrhea, tired all the time,, but i have had 3 pet scans at 3 months apart all negative. i am a 52 year old man, non smoker"	-10
133742	i was prescribed bactrim ds for a paronychia infection on my right index finger. there was no apparent abscess so the doctor felt a script of bacrtim ds would do the job. after taking the first pill i began to fill dizzy and nauseous. over the next few days i had barely any appetite and wanted to sleep all day. i felt like i could not get enough sleep. i was also extremely sensitive to the sunlight which only enhanced my desire to sleep more. over all the infection did not appear to change in the 3 1/2 days on the antibiotic but that is not to say it did not work. i just was not able to function on it therefore i called my doctor for something else.	-10
15313	... only issue is that i became pregnant while taking. big issue...	-10
212538	"there is no cure for hsv2 but you can suppress it with lysine. you have to take it everyday and it just becomes part of your daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. i was diagnosed with hsv2 in 2012 and had outbreaks every single month for the first year. after that it was about every other month. it was a painful and humiliating experience for years. after introducing lysine, along with ole into my daily routine, i haven't had an outbreak since september 2015. if i feel like an outbreak may occur, i just up the dosage until that familiar tingling sensation goes away. i know lysine doesn't work for everyone, but i stand by it 100% for my hsv2 suppression."	-10
71796	"i've been dx with fibromyalgia. nsaids are not recommended as first line of pain relief. i'm on an ssri, a migraine rx, sleeping aids, anti anxiety, a muscle relaxer. slowly but surely my dr has been increasing my dose. i am currently at max dose per my dr, 2-50mg tablets 4 times a day. i can't say that it helps. out of all my meds, i don't think any of it really helps. :-("	-10
13240	"i have been taking adderall for quite some time but this month i went to cvs and got my normal 10mg, took them and felt nothing by the end of day i had taken 60mg, way more than normal and felt nothing but a headache. got my dr to switch the script to 20mg went back and got a faded looking orange pill with u30 on it, first of all it was all crumbly then it was bitter instead of the normal sweet taste, i have taken 60mg again and i'm about to fall asleep!!! cvs must know they are selling rubbish!!! next month i won't fill unless i make sure its not from these people!!"	-10
181478	"i took this medicine for 7 days lost my appetite the 3rd day, worsen my insomnia, it did not help with anxiety. by the 7th day i felt even worst finally decide to come off it. this is my second day off prozac and i still cannot eat, sleep still have bad anxiety and feeling sick to my stomach and cannot eat anything, i'm extremely nauseated, haven't ate much in 4-5 days. i hope my appetite comes back soon! this med did not work for me it made me feel horrible."	-10

87987	"dry socket gum abscess, took about 8 hours and two pills in the swelling went down....fast. good medicine for dry socket abscess, does take lots of water to work, however does work well for this particular application, in my experience anyways."	-10
93937	"life changing experience. i have been on many different medications on and off over the years, and trintellix is honestly the only thing that worked for me. pros: i was able to eat again! my depression and anxiety had caused me to lose over 30 pounds in just a few months, and i looked sickly. after 2 weeks on trintellix, i got my appetite back. my anxiety reduced, but didn't fully subside. i had xanax for emergencies when trintellix couldn't control my anxiety. i was still able to feel emotions, and never had sexual dysfunction. it helped me get my sleeping back on track, and i was able to establish a normal sleep schedule. cons: cost, thank goodness my doctor had a lot of samples becaue i could not afford the monthly cost every month."	-10
29367	i have suffered hormonal migraines since my early 20's (now early 40's). i had tried most everything for migraines and they were still coming and starting to cluster. i was put onto topirmirate by my gp at the recommendation of the specialist i saw after plan a stopped working after 6 months. i had some extremity tingling for about 6 weeks when i first started (i was slowly built up to 100mg daily dose). in the interest of full disclosure i am also a type 1 diabetic so i am monitored pretty closely for sight and kidney function and i have had no issues around this. i have also started taking an anti depressant to combat a hormone imbalance issue so i don't get the mood swings either.	-10
188494	"hi ladies! so i got my paragard iud inserted this past january. i am 21, with no children, and i have never been on birth control before this. i was diagnosed with manic depression back in 2010, and although i am no longer taking prescription meds, i will always be manic, moody, and very temperamental. because of this, the idea of a birth control with hormones really scared me! i knew it would affect my emotional and mental health in a severe way where everyone around me would suffer lol. paragard is hormone-free which is what initially caught my attention. it's been almost 8 months and i'm loving my iud. minor cramps during menstration, whereas before i never experienced cramping. my period is also slightly heavier, but it's manageable!"	-10
36360	"i am a gi specialist and i have prescribed pylera many times.... should have asked my patients better about their experiences with side effects. why? because i was diagnosed with h. pylory gastritis myself and chose pylera as first choice eradication! what a nightmare! days 1-3 were ok but then i experienced all the above mentioned side effects, crept to work, lost 6 pounds of weight and as one of you mentioned: thats how chemotherapy must feel like! i fought through (under the concerned pitiful looks of my collegues) and finished yesterday still feeling pretty bad and exhausted. hope it worked!"	-10
108371	"i have been on contrave since mid-dec '14. i weigh every 3 months and in march 2015, i had lost 40 lbs. i wish it was a lot more but i know slow weight loss is the best way to assist in keeping it off. i eat approx 500 calories/day and have one &quot;cheat&quot; day where i eat whatever i want. i have found on those &quot;cheat&quot; days, i can not even begin to eat the amount i used to eat. now part of that is from lower intake of food, but the contrave does make me feel fuller even on normal days. i have found that the hunger/appetite comes back and then will go away few times each month. when i was ramping up, it did make me nauseous and i can't stand to be nauseous but i got through it. worse side effect right now is a horrible bitter taste after sleeping"	-10
40488	"i took savella for about 45 days. i started out on the titration pack. the more i took it the worse i felt: nausea, headaches, dizziness, dry mouth, dry eye balls, etc. while taking savella i was also taking 40mg of paroxetine, which i have been taking since 1997. my doctor decided that i should come off the paroxetine and increase the savella to 200mg. i couldn't do it at the same time. so i weened myself off of the savella in about a week and now i am in my second week of weening myself off of the paroxetine. i don't know if i will try savella if i get off paroxetine or not. i have come off paroxetine before to try other drugs: efexor,celexa,lyrica,cymbalta, but always went back."	-10

19168	"the pain from fibromyalgia comes as muscle cramping, tingling, twitching, spasms, etc. it is not a &quot;nerve&quot; illness per se, yet doctors think people are stupid and prescribe this anyway. it does nothing for the pain or fatigue from fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue/m.e. until people realize that legitimate users of meds such as hydrocodone, morphine er, etc are rarely abused by people in genuine chronic pain, doctors will continue to jeopardize patients lives by giving them meds like this as a placebo with nasty side effects. one doctor also put me on paxil which gave me serotonin syndrome and i was in intensive care for a week! this was when ssri's first came out and i went into med journals. avoid this for chronic muscle pain."	-10
193450	"amrix is the best. i have taken many muscle relaxers over the years and they all make me sleepy, (which i despise). i take amrix after dinner and i sleep comfortably and wake refreshed and able to make it through the day with only aleve or ibuprofin. i am so greatful for amrix."	-10
218680	"i have a similar experience to other reviewers. i had my gallbladder removed in 2002. and have had irritable bowel syndrome for 15 years, with each year it seems to get worse. i couldn't tolerate spending 1/2 my day in the bathroom. it was so awful that i looked for where the bathroom was at a restaurant before i ordered, just so i knew where to go when the meal was done. when the stomach cramps and the, &quot;oh poop, i gotta poop&quot; feeling came on. by the 2nd day of taking welchol, it started working for me. i only went to the bathroom once, the entire day! for me, that was a miracle. i still try not to eat trigger foods or drink coffee (i love coffee, but my stomach thinks otherwise) but at least i can live a normal life again, something i had forgotten about."	-10
113072	had to use this for the final step of the bowel prep for colonoscopy. i tolerated a miralax and gatorade combination for three hours. i started that at 5 o'clock. was finished by 7:30. at 9 o'clock i was instructed to take two tiny ducolax pills. i awoke at 11 to severe nausea. i dry heaved for about a half hour and then started vomiting violently. i broke out in a cold sweat and my hands went numb. i thought my husband was going to have to take me to the emergency room . the vomiting lasted for an hour. i finally fell asleep at 1:30 in the morning. i informed my g.i. prior to the call anoscopy about my horrible experience with this drug. i will never take it again.	-10

46269	"modafinil changed my life. i didn't know what genuine contentment was before i went on it. currently i am taking abilify and modafinil together, and i appreciate my life in a whole new way. i feel a sense of control in that i don't have to worry about depression or hypomania impairing my concentration. every once in a while i get sad, but my periods of sadness seem much more normal and bearable in that they only last a few days (as opposed to weeks or months). i feel happy most of the time, but it's not overwhelming the way my hypomania used to be. last year i kept having allergic reactions to medications, and i was convinced i wouldn't be able to spend the rest of my life living with bipolar. i am so happy that i discovered modafinil."	-10
176283	"do not take benzos for insomnia - they work great, until you reach tolerance, and then you go into full withdrawal unless you up the dose considerably. by then you probably will have already found the dirty underside of this terrible drug, which is agoraphobia, brutal insomnia, loss of motivation and stunning depression. next, you'll find out that you cannot withdraw from this drug in a reasonable manner, and the required tapering-off methods could take years. during withdrawal you will have the worst insomnia imaginable, for months on end, and nothing will relieve it, except more benzos than any doctor will prescribe. don't even start on this evil drug. if you think this is an overreaction, google &quot;benzodiazepine withdrawal&quot;."	-10

195465	i'm on my second month of taking this bc and noticed in the first month my face was very dry. had a few small breakouts. this could also be contributed from using glycolic acid cream. but i have had some pretty bad bloating and terrible gas and constipation. though it did help the length of my cycle from 10/15 days down to 5/7 days. cramps are a breeze compared to before aviane. sex drive isn't high but i had issues with my sex drive before taking aviane. pretty bad breast tenderness and growth. if this bc is not the reasoning for my tummy issues then i would recommend it.	-10

33739	"this is by far the worst pill ever. i was on zovia and i absolutely loved it, and they stopped making it so i switched and they put me on this and when i started taking it i was bleeding for two weeks straight, and i figured it was just an adjustment period, also i would cry all the time, i wasn't sad or upset, nothing happened, i just couldn't help it i always was holding back the urge to cry. so after that lovely two week blood bath i had like five days without bleeding and then it started all over, so i've been bleeding for a month straight, and i want to cry all the time."	-10
131161	"i used to use depo-provera for about 8 years. i have two girls 13 and 7. i decided to change to mirena with our busy schedule so that i don't have to keep coming in every 3 months for a shot. the first 24 hours of cramping was not pleasant. but as with depo-provera i have continued to not have a period and no weight gain for me. i strongly recommend for anyone with a busy family life who wants good birth control, if you didn't get your tubes tied."	-10
129871	"i had the skyla insertion after being on the pill and absolutely hated the hormones. i had it inserted about 8 months ago. insertion was a bit uncomfortable but nothing unbearable. cramps were mild for a few days and some bleeding. i have had few side-effects. i gained around 6 pounds which sucked but i'll take it over baby weight. my boyfriend nor i can feel it during sex. i don't get a period anymore it seems which is pretty great, at first it got lighter and lighter and then just went away. it's worry free and lasts 4 years. definitely getting it done again when the 4 years is up."	-10

129625	"i'm sorry to be the negative nancy, but the past two nights of my life have been miserable. i am 26 yrs old with no pregnancies or children. yes, the insertion process hurt really, really badly! don't let the high-pain tolerance of these chicks fool you. it hurt, but it was fast. the whole procedure lasted maybe 5-6 minutes from prep to finish. just had to cuss and laugh my way through it. had no problems the rest of the day...until i went to bed. what followed was excruciating pain!! lasted about two hours. nothing helped me. today, i have been fine under high doses of ibuprofen. i cleaned house and went to work. i climbed into bed and prayed for no more pain. have been wide awake since 5am (it's 6:52) in horrific agony!!"	-10
91641	"xyrem has changed my life. for the first time, i can awaken from sleep feeling refreshed. for the first time, i can achieve a deep sleep. the quality of sleep that i get while on xyrem is a miracle. before xyrem, i used to sleep extremely light all night long, while waking dozens of times and tossing and turning. between constant rem (dreaming) and spurts of very light sleep, i was so exhausted in the morning and i could barely function during the day. also, i had a hard time with falling to sleep at night. and trying to maintain a set sleep schedule was nearly impossible."	-10
173129	"i, like many of the above folks, have had a terrible problem with night terrors, aka nightmares, horrible dreams. i really don't know if nightmares and night-terrors are the same thing, but i experienced a limbo state between sleep/wake and i am not a kid...58 actually. in the old days, when i was a kid, the doctor put me on the old drugs in use then, i.e. seconal....barbiturates..this was 45 years ago. sure, those really knocked me and i slept like the proverbial log, but the &quot;hangover&quot; was so bad i could not attend school. i do not know when clonazepam was introduced, but i had this problem off and on all my life and clonezepam reduced the problem significantly, not a cure but a tremendous help."	-10
11443	"although the medication did effectively treat my cancer the side effects were so severe that i decided to discontinue use of the drug and try an alternate treatment. skin rash started on my hands initially and spread to my entire body causing severe itching and scratching which led to something looking like opened bug bites all over. severe gum irritation described by my dental hygienist as your gums are flapping in the wind, also red swollen gums which caused me to be unable to eat anything not soft. lost 10 lbs the first two months. also projectile vomiting, diahrea and nausea. at three months i found it had made me diabetic and raised my triglycerides to over 500. that's when i opted to stop treatment."	-10
32090	"switching from another antidepressant to wellbutrin xl, made my depression worst. i became very hostile. ugly mood changes. changing from one antidepressant to another is the worst thing that i ever did in my life. some family members are not speaking to me because of my hostile actions toward them. every day i used was a sad day."	-10
68203	"i'm 18 years old. completely afraid after having unprotected sex, i took plan b about 27 hours later. there was no ejaculation inside, but the risk still runs with pre-ejaculation. only a couple days late, i started my period. i had no side effects at all from taking plan b, but i did make sure to have it with food. ladies, i'm not sure if it worked for me, or if i was even at risk of getting pregnant, but take the necessary precautions. the stress, the fear, the unpreparedness, it isn't worth it. always keep it safe from stds with protection, anyhow. plan b is a back up plan, use birth control and a condom! good luck and relax! stress can delay your period! &lt;3"	-10

154196	"i was prescribed nexium after 4 months of trying every other prescription med out there, following 4 months of severe gerd/ silent reflux symptoms. within the first 2 days of taking nexium the lump feeling in my throat started to go away. i am taking 40 mg of the teva generic nexium and so far i feel way better. hopefully it lasts. i was on dexilant before 60mg once a day and it gave me about 50% symptom relief. nexium is the best ppi i have tried for sure and i would recommend to anyone."	-10
60345	"i have been using the ring for a few months now as an alternative to ortho evra (the patch). i was tired of the patch coming off, getting stuck to my clothing, and causing skin irritation. i like the ease of use of the ring and being able to forget about it for three weeks. however, i have experienced a very noticable decrease in my desire to have sex as well as vaginal irritation (itching and discharge). i tend to take it out before sex also because certain positions caused pain with it in. i'm still debating getting off of this birth control because of the side effects."	-10
848	"put on silodosin for decreased urine flow. after four days on the meds i came but didn't ejaculate. not taking it anymore. i wasn't told it was a side effect, scared the life out if me tbh. fortunately my wife is medically qualified and researched the side effects."	-10
66142	i have had anxiety a lot since high school and it has gotten worse in college. i have taken many different medicines for anxiety and this is by far the best fit for me. i didn't like how i had to take the other medicines everyday whether or not i felt anxious- this one was great for me because my doctor told me i could take it whenever i felt a little more anxiety than normal. i will take it in the morning if i wake up anxious and i have never had an anxiety attack or feelings of being anxious yet. i would highly suggest talking to your doctor about this medicine if anxiety is the issue.	-10
163253	i was experiencing pain in my stomach and upper abdomen after about a month of using solaraze twice per day (was prescribed for three months). had to have an upper endoscopy to find the cause of my symptoms. i had burns to my lower esphagus and mild stomach bleeding. my doctor told me that a side effect of this medication (ointment applied to the skin on my face) can destroy the mucus lining in the stomach. use with extreme caution!	-10
163680	"i was given mirtazapine as an add on to my treatment with zoloft for major depression and anxiety. made me extremely tired to the point where i almost couldn't form a sentence and didn't care about anything but sleeping (and eating). it did help a little with the anxiety, but not at all with the depression, it made it worse since i had no energy whatsoever."	-10

86354	vile disgusting taste. i had to add a lemon powder and hold my nose to drink without vomiting. it took 20 min. to get it down. i hate to drink water and had a tough time drinking the required 32 oz. of water in 1 hour after the suprep. it did take effect in 40 min. i was also very bloated. i do not know if i can manage to drink the second dose tonight. i will have to find a way.	-10
68802	i haven't had a period in years i had my hormones checked and everything came back normal. the dr wanted me to try provera challenge. i'm on my 4th pill. i haven't had any side effects i don't feel its going to work. i dont have pms. i don't have sore breasts i don't have any cramps. i did take it at bedtime in case i feel drowsey and non of that has happened. if i don't bleed when i finish these pills then i either have hypothalmus or i went into ovarian failure :'-(	-10
48873	"i was perscribed lutera, and when i went to the pharmacy they gave me orsythia instead because it was more affordable for me, yet an equivalent of lutera. as of recently i have been experiencing a lot more headaches and migraines, which my doctor warned me about (since i have family and personal history of severe migraines). i haven't gained any weight, my periods are very light and about 4 days long. they start on the third inactive pill. in addition, my breasts have increased in size but not been tender. i like orsythia. i was very paranoid about taking birth control, but orsythia was a lot better for me than i expected, however if my migraines continue i will need to switch :("	-10
109619	"i've had my implant for 2 years now. when i first got it, i was finishing out my menstrual cycle &amp; asked the heath care provider if it was going to be an issue. i was told that my cycle would be fine. i spotted on &amp; off for 3mo. but after, i was having cycles regularly. then, i was bleeding for a month straight. after that, i didn't get my next cycle for 4 months. during that time, i had switched jobs &amp; was working around alot more females than originally. i've been an emotional wreck the entire time &amp; have had terrible mood swings. it's effective with not getting pregnant, but it takes an emotionally strong person to deal with the side effects of it. wouldn't recommend for everyone, but it is good for a changing schedule everyday."	-10
159677	i had an incredibly bad reaction to bactrim that led to multiple organ dysfunction / failure. i ended up in icu for several days with liver and kidney failure that progressed into a pulmonary edema / a.r.d.s.. i came very close to dying after my kidneys shot down and my lungs filled with fluid. i have now been advised to never take another sulfa based drug.	-10

196802	"holy hell is exactly how i feel. i had been taking brisdelle for 1.5 years. the hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact noven was acquired by yet another pharmaceutical company - you can't place a rep in the area, distribute your drugs, and then fire her-and not replace therefore there is no medicine or support here. you dumped this drug in the dr's hands and walked away. after calling sebula - you act like you don't even care. you have made it impossible to obtain this. i happen to think this is illegal. i just decided to wean myself off this and premarin. it has been nothing short of a nightmare. if you don't need this drug- don't start. seriously."	-10
110480	"i have been on nexplanon for for about 2 years now. i was given the micro pill to try out before getting the nexplanon rod put in which is the exact same thing as the rod, but in pill form just to see how i do with the side effects. immediately 3 days on the pill i started bleeding non-stop until the day i got the rod put in. 1 week after having the rod put in i bled for 1 month straight non-stop. extreme moodiness. i felt i was getting depressed and extreme cramps. after about 6 months the mood swings went away and i would still bleed a lot. i would have a period ever other week and sometimes i would skip 3 months. it all depends. other than that i love this birth control because of how less likely it is to get pregnant!"	-10
178254	i have been on cymbalta 120mg for three years now and still feel no difference. i suffer from major depression and anxiety. it has done nothing for my illness. my psychiatrist also has me on wellbutrin 150mg and abilify which i guess is supposed to jump start the antidepressant but so far since being on it i have been to cpep two times which is a mental ward at the hospital. and common i read where some have felt a difrence in 48 hours or a week that is bull. finally my pdoc is going to put me on maoi's as i have been on so many of the new antidepressants for the past 10 years &amp; nothing has worked but cymbalta is no miracle drug.	-10

20780	only drug that worked to break a 1 week bad migraine cycle. i used one im injection and within an hour the pain was totally gone. the only side effect was waking up a lot during the night.	-10
138335	"i've been taking tamoxifen for 10 months now. at first, i seemed okay. the doctor prescribed effexor at the same time to combat any menopausal symptoms. i fell into a bad funk. severe depression and not sleeping. i stopped taking the effexor (doctor wasn't too happy) thinking that was causing some adverse effects. he put me on trazodone 50 mg for sleep. that worked for a short period of time so they upped the dosage to 100 mg at night. however, my depression is tenfold. i'm so irritable and angry all the time. the slightest thing sets me off. i can't stand to be around people. i can't concentrate and my appetite has decreased. i've lost about 8 pounds. i just don't feel right, ever, anymore. i have to stay on this for 5 years."	-10
190996	i've had problems for so long i've been bounced around from doctor to doctor and they all told me i was making it up that i didn't really have all these bowel problems. my pediatrician told me and my mom i was faking to get attention. i've had 4 colonoscopies and an endoscopy in 2 years. since this medicine i have never felt better. i still have a lot of issues but this medication is the best thing i have found and the relief is astonishing.	-10

27591	"i developed severely dry feet after moving to michigan from the mid-south, and i was regularly getting large painful blisters under the dry skin. it seemed counterintuitive to moisturize the skin vs using moleskin or similar, but it works. i use it for almost all dry, cracking skin and it works fast, healing things up in a couple days. it burns for a moment if i apply it to freshly scrubbed skin, but can't find anything else but positive results."	-10

56159	"after my first and only shot, ten days after i broke out in a rash from head to toe. the interesting thing was the area i had given my shot was red and made a rather large circle surrounding the area where i inserted the needle. contacted my doctor and she prescribed steroids to counteract the rash. later in the evening i was in the most excruciating pain in my legs this lasted all night into the early morning. even contemplated going to the er. in the ten days being of humira i had no relief from pa. i have some plaque psoriasis and i will say that cleared up in the ten days that i was on it, only to return shortly thereafter. on a side note i would like to say humira has a wonderful support staff should you have any questions."	-10
64138	"i've had a lot of success with zoloft both as an antidepressant and for generalized anxiety disorder. it has worked for me for almost 2 years now and has really kept my symptoms under control. i'm of very small weight and sensitive to medications, so 25 mg works for me reasonably well. i have had to up my dosage to 50mg during times of high stress and it has helped so much. the only side effects i have experienced were a little nausea, some apathy, and insomnia. other than that, i have tolerated this medication very well. it helps me put things into perspective and stops me from my having such negative, anxiety ridden thinking patterns. it helps me live in the moment and takes away a lot of my worries. i would definitely recommend."	-10
3959	1200mg xr per day worked and stopped my mental process enough to pave the road to recovery. i developed arthritis in both hands and the most savage addiction ever known to man i was now facing. i have now stopped compleatly and all the words and reviews can never prepare you for such an experience. i took the cold turky approach and 3 months of violent withdrawls i have stayed clear. i would recommend other treatments before this as a last resort. it saved my life but at what cost. i still have mental health issues amd arthritis but i quickly get on with my day when i realise i could be back taking them.	-10

148747	"i received the mirena today finally, i had been looking at the reviews and they wasn't good reviews so decided i was going to give it a try anyway. everyone has different bodies along with different symptoms i went in an my doctor told me my uterus was tilted and i was going to feel a sharp pain which i did it felt like a huge cramp and it took the breath out of me but that's the only reason why it hurt that much was because my uterus was tilted other wise it wouldn't have been that sharp. i laid there for a min and got up i had cramps but the cramps stopped due to me taking ibprofen which helps a lot. i am bleeding which is normal and it's not heavy if you've had a child before and your epidural didn't help you can handle this pain."	-10
171936	"i am 55 and have been living with ibs-c for the last 10 yrs. my doctor started me on amitiza a week ago. i am on 24mcg twice daily. i took my initial dose at the beginning of a meal. it caused pretty severe nausea, but really cleaned me out with 4 or 5 small bm's ranging from normal to explosive diarrhea. i have taken each subsequent dose in the middle of a meal, and have had the most normal bowel pattern than i have had in years. no more nausea, reflux, cramping or gas. this med is allowing me to have several small bm's daily, as opposed to using laxatives, which is miserable. i hope it continues to work! i'm using samples from my doctor right now. not sure if insurance is going to cover it."	-10
122426	i started linzess 290 after i had surgery for an anal abscess which resulted in an anal fistula. i was told i had an infected anal gland which could have been caused by blocked stool due to prolonged constipation. it is very important that i keep from being constipated as this condition could occur again. i am worried about the explosive diarrhea that happens every morning for about an hour. i wonder how this constant diarrhea affects the colon. if i skip a day i do not have a bm but i think i need to give my colon a rest every other day. hoping once i have been on linzess for awhile the diarrhea will subside.	-10

205957	i have been taking pristiq for 3 months. wonderful medication. i feel great! the only side effect i have is so much night sweats i have to keep a second pajamas next to my bed because mine gets soaked. i was wondering if this side effect will get better. i am very reluctant to change this medicine because of this effect because other anti-depressants had the same effect and did not work as well.	-10
60770	"just finished my first 1 liter dose about 2 hours ago. taste was not as bad as i was afraid of, honestly the lemon/salty taste reminds me very much of a margarita! started to work before i was finished drinking it, and already only 2 hours in i feel pretty cleaned out and the trips to the bathroom which where at first every five minutes are now every 15 minutes. i don't have my next dose until 6 am tomorrow, so at this rate i am reasonably sure i will get some sleep tonight. some mild cramps but not bad. with blue cross/blue shield my out of pocket was $20. worst part so far has been the nervousness leading up to my first dose after reading the horror stories on this site. i slept though the night, up at 6 for dose 2, no problems."	-10

16489	"i have been taking this pill for almost a year, probably by far the worst birth control i've ever taken (side effects wise). this pill makes you bleed and spot all the time. i take it at the exact time every single day and yet somehow my period will start like 2 weeks before i'm supposed to get it and it will last for like a week of just pure spotting. this is verrrrrry annoying and inconvenient for a woman with a boyfriend. you never know if one day you're just going to start bleeding or not. periods are just as bad as before i was on the pill, cramps, bloating, and heaviness of bleeding varies. i also have almost a non existent sex drive which sucks. also i have been having stomach issues on and off since i've been taking this."	-10

112166	"originally i was prescribed this and meloxicam as a two-pronged approach for pain, and it has reduced my opioid dosages. let's say my pain management doctor had me on levels greater than given to cancer patients. when my pm increased it to that level, my primary took over. first i was taking gabapentin 200mg 3x. however, still having sleep issues. she sent me to a neurologist and she changed how i take it, kept the dosage. now, i take 200mg at noon, and 400mg two hours before i go to sleep. what a difference it made. and it still helps with pain management as it was originally prescribed. due soon for an increase. it helped reduce my opioid dosage."	-10

168681	"suicidal early 20s-previous control found with counseling, zoloft, effexor, no other drugs giving much or lengthy control of disease. about 2 yrs ago began viibryd-quickly brought up to 40 mg dose. still have dry mouth and some diarrhea (so bad at first it actually turned into ibs for me) and continue with daily headaches and queasiness, though no weight gain as others reported. last 5-6 months have noticed sharp increase in sudden unexpected crying with no ability to stop, and now more aggressive feelings and an increase in suicidal ideation which i have not had for many years. very surprising and frightening after all this time (40 years since diagnosis). will wean off this drug soon when/if i can find a dr to address these issues"	-10
182962	"i have had fibro, depression, anxiety, chronic horrible pain. cymbalta does nothing at all. i don't even know why i take it. if you stop it's worse than stopping anything else i have ever tried to except maybe xanax. i am so happy for all you that it works for. life is depressing and miserable. pain meds were the only thing that has helped for pain but i have been on them so long i want to try something else. so sick of people who think pain meds cause the problem. of course i am on a higher dose than someone who just started. it's been ten years. i wish cymbalta helped as much as you guys."	-10
127616	"i started out weighing 197lbs. i've fluctuated from 180-195 for the last 5 years. it's been awful. i'm 38 so shedding pounds is extremely difficult. i finally got a prescription for phentermine and i'm down 8 lbs in just 1 week with healthy eating. no counting calories. just tons of veggies, lean turkey burger patties, vega protein shakes and lots of water. my goal is 130lbs since i'm only 5'2&quot;. i did decide to take a whole pill yesterday and it gave me a massive headache. won't be doing that again."	-10
115541	i was given diprivan at the start of a colonoscopy. it worked very quickly and i awoke to no side effects.	-10
27075	i used this medicine to kick major withdrawals from heavy pain killers. it took the edge off with xanax. it doesn't work for pain though i can't imagine it working for anyone unless your pain is minimal.	-10
137999	i suggest if you're going to use these patches that you use them perfectly according to the instructions. i had imperfect (but not terrible) use and ended up pregnant on my 7th month being on them. the side effects weren't better or worse for me as compared with other bc. i didn't have some problems with peeling and loosening.	-10
224935	"i took zyban for about 2 months back in 1999. i had smoked for about 25 years before that and had tried to quit with no success. i was sceptical about zyban because i was a hard core smoker, and was only half motivated to quit. nothing changed for the first two weeks or so, then i thought i would limit myself to 3 per hou, next week the limit was one per half hour, then one per hour.now i was about 5 or 6 weeks in. i stayed on zyban, and would take a few smokes with me to work. one day on my way to work i was having a smoke and thinking about it and realized the only reason i was smoking now is because i was bringing them with me. i butted it out, and never looked back. i can be around smokers and not be tempted by it now too."	-10
32931	started spotting 3rd week starting seasonique generic camrese. bleeding was very minimal spotting the first week. but i am now on my 9 th day and started passing clots. my periods before starting seasonique were at most 5-6 days long i've never in my life experience bleeding for so long. i started this bc in hopes of not having so many periods and since i was very irregular i wanted to control it. only thing so far i've experienced is more bleeding!!! i'm getting married in 3 months what am i supposed to do if this bleeding doesn't stop?! does anyone suggestions? otherwise i'm thinking of just stopping altogether	-10
37	"i got one dose of the depo shot may 2015. two months after getting the shot i had spotting here &amp; there. it's november 2015 now &amp; for the past 4 months i've had spotting almost everyday, painful sex, no sex drive, fatigue, always hungry &amp; i've gained weight like crazy. i get irritated very easily, &amp; get mood swings. lately i've been bleeding heavily it's annoying! i have an appointment in 2 months to see what's going on &amp; i was told the depo shot isn't suppose to stop your periods until 2nd or 3rd shot. the only reason i got the depo was because my period was horrible, it was heavy the whole time &amp; the cramps were unbearable. i most definitely don't recommend the depo shot!"	-10
169642	"i was previously on cymbalta, 60mg daily, for migraine prevention. i liked it and had minimal side effects. i lost my job and am now only on tricare so the doctor put me on elavil, 10mg. he told me to increase the dose by 10mg every four days. i was drowsy on 10mg and a little less drowsy at 20mg. as soon as i increased to 30mg i couldn't sleep and felt shakey during the day. i tried it for four nights and, after about 4 or less hours of sleep each night, i reduced the dose to 20mg. i noticed my neck pain decreased at the 30mg but i can't function without any sleep. i have had two migraines while on the 10 and 20mg doses of this medication. ssris usually make me hyper and get insomnia so i wasn't surprised."	-10
102061	"i've been reading other people's experiences and i wonder if i'm on the same medication. i am 74 years old, and i've been on brilinta with 81 aspirin since 2/29/16, when i had 92% blockage in the widow maker, the descending major heart artery. thankful that i was in the doctor's office when i had my heart attack, i ended up with two stents and brilinta. i have had no noticeable side effects. i exercise three days a week in our local life center, with both aerobic and resistance exercises, and i have never experienced anything like the excessive fatigue i read others complaining of. other than cuts or scrapes taking a little longer to coagulate i have had no bleeding to complain about. maybe the brilinta i'm receiving is just better."	-10
217443	on day 3 of taking this! throat still sore and have got an absolutely vile vile vile taste in my mouth which i cannot get rid of! can't deside which is worse the tonsillitis or this sickening taste! also feeling hungrier than normal but then food tastes gross because of this acidic metal taste	-10
72777	"my experience with this bc started out well but quickly took a horrible turn. i had been on it a few years ago and experienced moods swings so i stopped taking it. i started again about 3 months ago. while i had no period, crapping, or acne..it caused me to be more anxious than i ever had been. i have barely slept in days, i feel extremely depressed and have a negative outlook on life. this bc ruined me, nausea, leg pain, anxiety and depression. please be careful if you have a history of anxiety or depression taking this. the mood swings just aren't worth it. losing my sex drive and have been pulling away from my boyfriend. i would definitely not recommend this bc to anyone, even someone i hated lol."	-10
101692	"i fell and fractured my shoulder back in march. i was originally given flexeril 10mg did nothing, went back for more tests found out i have 2 extra cervical ribs and thoracic outlet syndrome. robaxin 750mg 3x's a day doesn't really help me either. my pain level is a consistent 7 makes it hard to sleep."	-10
146676	"i had my first baby at 15 years old, i was not on any method of birth control. i have been on the pill ever since i was 16 years old. stopped the pill at 24 to have a baby and had twins. then went back on it for 5 years and stopped it to have another baby, then started the pill again. after 15 months i stopped the pill to have another baby and been on it since. this pill is wonderful. i would reccoment it to anybody. they work very well."	-10
35523	"i have taken this medication for over two decades and it works well. without it i wouldn't be able to hardly eat anything. if i run out and have to wait to get my refills .. it usually takes several days before any horrible symptoms come back. i try to get my meds before that happens. it really does help in making life so much better. you can eat in a normal fashion but sensible. i try to drink plenty of water, so my meds won't be to much of a strain on my bladder &amp; kidneys and all my organs. i know without this medicine i couldn't even drink water without suffering the consequences.. it was that bad."	-10
190486	"i was given stadol via iv while in labor with my eldest child. i don't know what dose but i did go unconscious for what i think was a few seconds. i just remember waking up gasping for air as about 6 nurses rushed into the room. they were trying to get me to breathe and checking my vitals. not sure if i flatlined but i did have to remember to breathe, which wasn't fun. i remember feeling really high and happy after giving birth but it took me a long time to come down from it. i had my two younger children without meds and felt much better and aware of my surroundings. the stadol did help with pain but i'll never forget how hard it was too breather when you have to consciously make an effort to do it."	-10
199849	"started chantix and had horrible dreams at night and depression / suicidal thoughts during the day. after a week, i stopped taking it and continued to smoke. i tried the drug again the next year and had amazing results. the medication completely curbed my desire to smoke. i also lost the urge to drink mt. dew. anyways, i quit smoking for 2 years. after not smoking for 2 years my oldest child became ill and was hospitalized. i ended up smoking again during this life event. i immediately started taking chantix after he left the hospital and the drug worked again. i have not smoke for many years and have lost the urge to pick the habit back up. please, please do yourself a favor and use this life enhancing drug. it was the best decision"	-10
190410	"i was on ortho tri-cyclen lo for about 2 months. couldn't continue with them due to the side effects. i was terribly hormonal and i wanted to eat everything in sight. i cried all the time and everything made me upset and moody. at the time i was 17 (now 18), 5'4&quot; and about 118lbs. it made me gain weight and go up to 126lbs that i now have trouble getting rid of. hope this helps!"	-10
9671	"i'm 20, and i've been on this birth control for about a year and it's been nothing short from fantastic!!! the low dose is great, i get no noticeable side effects like i did on some of the higher dose generics, which were pretty bad. i also love not getting periods... i'll maybe have one day of light bleeding every once and awhile. highly recommend! lo lo is awesome!"	-10
223571	"taking sonata was like taking a placebo. no matter when i took it - 5 minutes before bedtime, 1 hour, 2 hours, i would lie awake for hours! i even tried doubling up with no change. once i did fall asleep i would wake up 2 hours later, then 2 hours after that - never getting a restful nights sleep."	-10
138024	"i've been on the patch for over a year now. i have had no side effects, but i've never had a side affect with any medication i've ever been. i have had a couple pregnancy scares, thankfully all false alarms. i went on birth control to regulate my period and it has worked wonders. i have got my period on tuesday every fourth week since the first time month of being on it, that was why when i didn't get it at all the one month i thought i might have been pragnent. the only down side i have found to the patch is that there are lots of places i can't put it,( my butt, under my bra, my hip) any place that clothing would rub up against on a regular basis, so in the summer trying to find somewhere it won't show on my bathing suit is hard."	-10
209980	i have been taking linaglitine for the last 10 month. it is useful but itching all my body. lost some the appetite. makes me tired.	-10
39920	"i was prescribed this rx because i can't lose weight, even after following a diet and exercising. i'm starting on my 4th week and i am thoroughly disappointed thus far. it hasn't suppressed my appetite or controlled my cravings at all. indeed, i have gained 5lbs since starting! also, this week i am having pounding headaches that won't go away, as well as severe constipation. most disappointed, as this rx was not covered by my insurance and it was expensive."	-10

100790	"i have been taking apri for about 2 years now. at first, it was great. my periods were managable, extremely predictable, and only lasted a few days. i gained about 10 pounds in the first 5 months, and shortly after completely lost my sex drive. recently my periods have been getting longer, as they used to be, and cramps are coming back as well."	-10
228614	"i just started this medication. with each injection the side effects have gotten worse. i did my 3rd dose last night &amp; i'm miserable. the body/muscle aches, headaches etc. are about unbearable. each time i took two 500 mg tylenol before my injection as recommended by my training nurse. i was told about the flu like symptoms, read the booklet my neuro gave me, but i thought the symptoms would subside at least halfway through the next day. i am so pained. i keep taking tylenol &amp; even my muscle relaxer hoping for relief. but nothing seems to help. i called into biogen after my 2nd dose. no help. copaxone gave me bad brain fog &amp; injection site reactions. tecfidera kept me in the bathroom in unbelievable pain. not sure what to do now."	-10
13208	"my father had a head injury 3 weeks back, had mild sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, no surgical intervention was required, was being treated conservatively. but he developed persistent hyponatremia, his serum sodium level gradually went down to 104 meq/l. after a battery of investigations, it was diagnosed as siadh. despite all efforts to correct his serum sodium level, it was seesawing between 104 and 108. strident fluid restriction and aggressive hypertonic saline therapy even baffled. then we started tab demeclocycline 300 mg thrice daily and it magically started causing its much desired adverse effect of producing more watery and less saline urine on its second day! kudos to this wonderful gut-sterilizer! my father is getting improved."	-10
33674	i have been on this pill for two years while on the pill everything was great. i decided to come off because we are planning on having a child and now i have the most horrible acne. i never had acne as a younger adult and now as a 28 yr old how embarrassing. i would not recommend this pill to anyone!	-10
101336	"i recently just stopped taking lyza because i realized it wasn't help me get my period back . before that i was on depo (the shot) which got rid of my period completly . i just started taking this birth control (aubra) and so far, i haven't notice any really crazy symptoms or spotting. i would get mild headaches but nothing ibuprofen couldn't fix. i'll update soon :)"	-10

13689	"i am 23 now and i was diagnosed at the age of 8 with adhd. i was put on ritalin until i was 17. ritalin made me stay up all night, it made me depressed. it was a terrible experience. adderall really helped me, it keeps me focused and on task and just overall it has changed my life."	-10

207832	"ok - disclaimer before i start: i have a fairly regular bowel and rarely experience any stomach discomfort!! i did a lot of reading on the internet so i felt that i was quite prepared for this experience. i stopped eating solid foods 24 hours before the prep deadline and i only had soup on the morning of prep day. i put the bottles of the mix into the fridge so when the time came, they were nicely chilled. at 4pm the day before the procedure, i used cool water to prepare the first cup which i was able to drink (even though i dislike cherry flavor) quite easily. the &quot;action&quot; started within 45 minutes and i did not experience any pain or nausea or discomfort. i was &quot;done&quot; by 8pm. and it was the same the next morning."	-10
106820	"i've had implanon for almost 2 years now and its not that bad really. i've gained 40 pounds and even though i exercise daily. my acne got worse sadly. when i started i had my period for a month straight, now its normal for the most part i get it for 7 days instead of 3 days. my sex drive isn't really that high either which i don't mind but not my boyfriend. overall i just like the idea of how i don't have to remember to take it or anything."	-10
95511	"the tylenol pm worked .... too good! after 20 minutes i would have a great night's sleep. i have been taking it for years .... then my son told me the new reports about this causing dementia. i stopped immediately. the side effects after i stopped have been pretty severe. i never dreamt that there would be withdrawals from this until i googled it but i have most of the symptoms (except for the shakes and nightmares).... dizzy, light headedness, nausea, unable to sleep. after all i thought, since i talked to my doctor over and over about them (and he said no problem) and they were over the counter, i was good. wrong! bad stuff. tell everyone you know to stop them."	-10
138851	"i started using this medicine 3 weeks ago and so far i have lost 10.8 lbs. i feel so much better. i also work out in the mornings at 6am 5-6 days per week. some days i only take 1/2, depends on how i feel when i get home from the gym. i love this pill. i get a lot more done at work and home. i started at 237 now at 226.2 my goal is 150-160lbs. i will be there by december 31st, 2010."	-10

150121	it got rid of my cough but then made my nose run like crazy. allergy symptoms while suffering from flu is a terrible combination. i am angry that my husband bought me this stuff instead of what i asked for. it kept me up all night and is making me irritable.	-10
19496	"i had lumbar decompression surgery in july for a herniated disk (l4,l5) and spinal stenosis. a week after the surgery, the nerve in my left leg and foot &quot;woke&quot; up and the pain was severe. my left foot was constantly burning, with feelings of electric shock 24 hours a day. i couldn't wear my shoe and i was very depressed by the pain - i couldn't walk barely without pain. my surgeon put me on lyrica and within a week, almost all of the burning disappeared. i get a random &quot;shock&quot; in my toes, a spasm in my arch and part of my foot is still numb, but i can function again. the pain is manageable and minor. i'm told it will heal but will take months. i've had some blurred vision, but that's better than the pain. lyrica was a life saver."	-10
168076	"i started taking this after i got a depo shot, which made me gain like 15lbs and made it hurt to have sex. when i started taking jolessa, i gained weight very quickly, going from 160lbs (i was 145lbs before depo shot) to 200lbs in like 6 months. no matter how healthy i eat, or how much i exercise, the weight won't drop. even doing p90x i can't get anywhere weight wise. this pill also totally killed my sex drive. i get moody, especially if i forget to take it a day or two, and start taking it again. i'm always tired. i never had any issues with pimples ever in my life, but when i take the white pills for the period or forget to take a few pills, i break out so bad. i hate this pill."	-10
217187	"i'm 70 and seemingly in excellent health. no pains or problems with anything. i work on my estate daily and have better energy than my younger by far workers. before i started taking human growth hormone (hgh), i found that my skin was growing very thin and becoming a slight pinkish blue. now this is completly resolved. i go to a life extension doctor that after testing found that my hormones like all older persons were low so i'm now supplementing with hgh, pregnalone, dhea, and testosterone (transdermal. i highly recommend it to my friends and acquaintances and to you to have your blood tested."	-10
113972	"i began taking this amlopidine for high blood pressure about a year ago. it worked fine for several months til i started having swelling and pain in my feet and legs. i was having some attacks of gout and thought that was it that causing the problem but the pain and swelling went on long after the gout. i got to where i could hardly walk. my wife noticed that swelling was a side effect. i quit the medicine immediately, and noticed a huge difference within a week. i have been off the medicine for 3-4 mths, but still have some problems with swelling and pain although not near as severe. i have also have developed knots in my calves while on this medicine that has not went away since stopping the medicine. i fear i have irreversible damage."	-10

123434	"i have been on apri since december 2008 when my daughter was 6 weeks old. at 1st i loved this pill. my periods came on time, weren't painful at all, really light and lasted 2-3 days. in the last year or so, my period has become very heavy, lasting 4-5 days with cramping for at least 4 days. i am miserable! after i had my daughter i had lost 50 lbs, but i have gained that and probably plus some back. i have no sex drive what so ever, which is affecting my relationship with my almost husband (in 5 weeks!) i go to my doctor next week to see about switching to a non hormonal iud. i have seen successful stories with apri, but i don't think this pill is for everyone."	-10
45361	"i was only on this medicine for one month. it was too strong for me. my anxiety and depression went away completely, but i also didn't care about anything. i completely lacked motivation and would sometimes just lay around doing absolutely nothing. i didn't even have much interest in eating. i also became antisocial and didn't want to leave the house, even to walk the dog, because i didn't want my neighbors to see me or talk to me. it was the weirdest experience. it's like i barely existed that whole month."	-10
49200	"i took aviane for about 3 years. i gained very little weight when i began taking it, but quickly dropped the lbs when i started paying attention to how i was eating. i never had any issues with an irregular period or acne, but my main side effect was moodiness. it took me a couple of years to figure out why i'd become this hyperemotional person, but then after much research, realized it was the aviane. i began to pay attention to my moods and regulate my mood swings, which helped. i've been off the pill for over a year now, but if i had to go back on birth control, i would choose this one again."	-10
48074	"even though reading the other reviews gave me so much hope, after just 1 week at 1.5 mg, the side effects are just too much for me. 12 hours after taking it, i feel like i've got stomach flu and vomit violently. also since starting i feel lethargic, will suddenly fall asleep, and i'm an absolute grump to be around. currently taking lithium and lamotrigine which can't seem to get a grip on the swings."	-10
17980	"i just switched to the ring at my doctor's suggestion after using the patch for a year and half. i've only been using the ring a month but i can not stand it. i initially worried about it getting stuck up inside me or being pushed in too far to reach during sex, and neither of those have been a problem. unfortunately the heavy vaginal discharge is too annoying to deal with. i know all birth control have side effects and discharge should not be a big concern, etc. i will be going back to the patch since i had no side effects while one it. my doctor switched me after my annual because she felt the higher levels of estrogen in the patch were &quot;not good.&quot;"	-10
120286	both my mom and i got episodes of anxiety after trying this.	-10
113887	"i had a horrible experience after being prescribed tegretol while in the hospital to treat my bipolar disorder. within a few days of starting it, i began experiencing the shaking, nausea, etc. but the worst was the extreme anger/irritability i started experiencing. it got to the point that i would have horrible rages and felt like i was completely losing control. i kept asking my doctor to take me off the tegretol, but he wouldn't. during one of these rages, i ended up fracturing my wrist because i hit a door so hard. after that, he agreed to take me off of it. after talking to other patients, i found out that a lot of them had similar experiences with this uncontrollable anger."	-10

202088	"40 yrs old &amp; last year tried the progesterone only pill for just 5 months (ceased that pill 4 months ago) but ever since my once near perfect skin has been plagued by constant hormonal spots. the doctor prescribed duac &amp; said it could cause redness &amp; drying. i used this for 2 nights only, last monday &amp; tuesday, applying just a very thin layer to all areas affected by spots as per the directions. by wednesday afternoon my skin had started going pink &amp; itchy so i didn't use it again. woke up thursday morning with red, itchy, burning patches all over, like port stain birthmarks, &amp; it is still driving me crazy now, trying not to scratch, using moisturisers but to no joy - 5 days it has been like this, wish i had not used it."	-10
100654	"i have allergy's really bad and my doctor prescribed alamast. i did not get any results whatsoever from this medicine. i had no side effects, or any relief from this drug either. it is very expensive (around $100 per bottle), and i used 2 bottles. however, someone else might have a better experience."	-10
177978	"after the removal of a tumour and bone graft surgery i suffered from debilitating pain that occurred at night which ultimately kept me from sleeping. for years, me and the doctors searched for the source of the pain but they could not find a reason and i was told to live with it. this year i was suggested cymbalta because my doctor had said it was working as a pain reliever for other patients. i was willing to try anything to rid the pain and after about 3 weeks i noticed a dramatic decrease in my pain. after a few months i am practically pain free. for those who deal with chronic pain on a daily basis this is best thing that could happen. i never thought anything would help, cymbalta has given me my life back."	-10
30079	"i have anxiety disorder and ocd which has made me depressed over the years. i have tried various ssri's and some antipsychotics, none of which seemed to help with my overwhelming anxiety obsessional thoughts and compulsions. they also gave me unwanted side effects. i am very scared when it comes to taking medication, and will only take a pill if i really need too. the only thing that seems to help in easing my mind is klonopin! i have no noticeable side effects from taking it . it makes me feel like my old self, helps me to be focused and relaxed, and gives me the confidence to do more things. i would definitely recommend this medication for other anxiety sufferers out there."	-10
144187	"i used nexplanon for 3 years and looking back i strongly regret it. my first month seemed normal followed by being on my period for 4 month without stopping. after the periods became less frequent my weight started constantly fluctuated all cycling around my period. i've gained 30 pounds over these 3 years and i eat healthy and exercise. additionally, i've had terrible mood swings and thoughts of suicide. i never had it taken out because it was nice not having to worry about taking a pill or having something inserted vaginally. i'm having it taken out in 2 days and could not be happier. i do not recommend this at all."	-10

127484	"i am now on my second round of phentermine. my first 3 months however were amazing! i'm so excited to see how the next 3 months go. i have lost over 45 pounds in 3 months on phentermine. i went from a size 22 in pants to a size 16. i can go more than just a few feet without losing my breath. i was in a hopeless situation with my body, i couldn't run, i couldn't breathe.. i could barely walk without losing my breath and energy. now i'm 236 lbs and i'm ready for round two! people say once you stop the medication you gain it all back. but my lowest was 232 and i've only gained 4 lbs in 3 months. (i was on 3 months, off 3 months) if you drink your water like you're supposed to, don't splurge on your calories or carbs, you will lose the weight!"	-10
175876	my doctor prescribed levaquin for my prostatis. he gave me a four week course and it has completely done the trick. it's been 6 months and still no sign of any prostatis. i had absolutely no side effects. if your lips are swelling you are probably allergic to the medicine and should stop immediately.	-10
121420	"originally on seroxat (paxil) for 17 years. felt so good on 20mg that after having my child i thought i would come off it as thinking of having second baby. i was put on prozac to help with withdrawal. after 4 months on prozac i was an absolute mess so dr put me on effexor. i've been on this now for 6 months. i cry literally every day. it has created obsessional and horrible thoughts, i am constantly tired. i have anxiety and panic. i feel it has actually created new symptoms that i never had. i do not like this drug and am coming off it as soon as i get an appointment with the psychiatrist"	-10
11011	"t used the paint on nail liquid for 18 months with no effect. i was changed onto terbinafine by the doctor, 3 weeks after taking it i have had no difference, have nausea every day and have completely lost all sense of taste. good side is i'm losing the excess half a stone, but i am starving."	-10
167370	"i have had the iud 2 times. the first time i had no problems very little cramping, very light to no bleeding. i went in 2012 after my son was born to get it again, and this time it was horrible. i had a lot more pain when inserted. i went back into for a checkup with my doctor to make sure it was in place, and he couldnt see it or feel the strings. so he told me that my body rejected it. so i thought he meant it fell out. i ended up going to the pill, and happen to be pregnant with my 3rd child. in 2015 i went to a chiropractor and had an xray done, and low and behold the iud was still in me. looked like it was inside the uterus too. now i am having to face the possibility of having surgery to get it out. my 3rd child was early and in nicu"	-10
111027	hi. i have always been sick with each pregnancy and was put on zofran. it worked sometimes. i have been taking diclegis for about a month and it work the same as zofran for me. sometimes it work- other times it doesn't. i am up to 4 polls per day. sometimes i still throw up and feel nauseous - like today. i guess the best thing for me is to get my tubes tied. i can't deal with this whole pregnancy thing ever again. i know one thing for sure that this is the very last pregnancy for me.	-10
69450	"4mg every day wipes away damn near all my withdrawal symptoms and allows me to be comfortable and live a much better life than i would without the subs. great stuff. recommend anyone that is stuck on opiates (heroin, oxy, shit even methadone) to give buprenorphine a chance."	-10
4014	"i went from talking 120mgs of cymbalta to taking 150 mgs of seroquel xr just over one year ago. i fortunately did not suffer from any if the initial side effects that i've now researched &amp; have learned are really common when starting this medication. however, 1 month ago, i'm not sure why but i ended up missing 2 nightly doses. what i experienced was nothing short of being in hell, literally. i physically was incapable of movement, getting up to simply get to the restroom was near impossible, every muscle in my body was weak &amp; near useless. i couldn't do anything but remain in a fetal position curled up on my side for the duration of over 12 hours. my head was cloudy, confused &amp; unable to process any thought. after this experience, i want off"	-10
122205	"i am 19 years old. i was diagnosed with depression/ocd/gad at 11 years. this medicine worked wonders for me. i took it for 3 years. i later began to think i'd be okay without it. now that i am back on effexor, it makes me really sick every time i take it. it made me put on a few pounds. i have taken almost every anti-depressant out there, and i have to say this is the best one. stay on it, even when you feel better."	-10
87382	i have been having a little tummy trouble the past few days and hadn't had a bm and it was starting to become unbarably uncomfortable. i took these last night about 10pm and woke up this morning around 3-4 in excruciating pain. i was sick a dog i did finally have a bm after sitting for about 20 min almost in tears from the cramps once a went the cramps subsided but only temporarily. i have been getting on and off cramps that feel like i am being repeadidly stabbed in my lower abdomen and to the point i feel like i may vomit. will not use this product again	-10
228009	"i have had the implanon for about 12 weeks and am going to have it removed next week. although a good form of contraception for preventing babies, i have found it made me moody, anxious and at times down-right depressed. also sometimes aggressive, and my libido dwindled to nothing (rather defeats the object). my poor young boys think an alien has inhabited their mummy's body, and they are the final reason i am having it taken out. i have been irritable beyond belief with them and never was before this went in. my husband wants his wife back, my kids want their mum back and i want my life back. it works for some people. it has not worked for me."	-10
95384	"otezla worked for me. (please read entire review). a little bit of a stomach ache for about a week for about an hour after each of the twice daily doses. i was given the drug for several months due to my financial state. first the free otezla stopped at 3 months, my psoriasis came back, a little worse than before. talked with dermatologist and they got it reinstated, and my skin again slowly cleared. but again, like before the gratis product ended at 3 months. my skin is now worse than ever. i guess i am looking for an answer. does taking this product with success and then stopping trigger a worse condition than when it was started. i really appreciate the company giving the product as paying $1233.00 p/mo as it was is impossible for me to afford it"	-10
53399	i was given this medicine during my colonoscopy. i'm an individual who is very sensitive to medications and i have an autoimmune disease. i don't like feeling drugged and this medicine gave me no side effects such as nausea or feelings as though i am dying as i had from morphine. i have had anesthesia too...unsure what was in that...but it also made me very nauseous. so this is a medicine i highly recommend if you need to have a medical procedure done but don't want to be completed sedated.	-10
104248	"i tried seasonique 3 month supply for birth control &amp; also to control my period's, for the first month i had no period then all of a sudden i bled for three months (full periods not just spotting). but you may try it and it may work for you, because as you know (no one woman's body is the same) so what happened to me may just be my case. if it works for you congratulations."	-10
133877	"my urologist prescribed this 3 years ago and gave me samples to try. it was amazing! it worked so well it seemed like magic. i am just thrilled with the results. while i still get up during the night, i don't have the worry of not getting to the bathroom before the urine drips down my leg. in addition, i don't get up as often, which gives me a much better quality sleep. during the day, my overactive bladder has calmed to the point where i feel normal! i'm so grateful to have this medicine. it has changed my life."	-10
43751	"i have been taking this medicine now for over 13 years. i used to take as much as 9 #4 a day. i now take only 4 pills a day. i get very bad pains in my feet because of being a diabetic, i have stopped getting pain by not waiting until the pain starts. it helps me sleep and most of the time it prevents the pain from starting."	-10
214945	it hurt each time i got the shot. the pain would be there for a week or so.	-10
179211	this drug didnt do shit to me. it actually made me feeling worse. my doctor doesnt want to take me off it. ive been taking it for 3 weeks for anxiety and hasnt done anything. plus i have put on 7 kilos. my dosage is 7.5 mg.	-10

231443	"do not recommend this medication. it works to put me asleep, but the side effects for me are too much. i had awful vivid nightmares all night, and woke up with tears streaming down my eyes from the dream. my nose was running the next day and i felt like a cold was coming in. the most disturbing side-effect was the extreme fatigue that lasted the entire next day, to the point that i had to call in from work. i was so tired and everything ached. will be consulting with my doctors asap."	-10
83488	i tried xyzal for the first time and it bottomed out my blood pressure and made me weak and almost fainting. i can't take it at all. anyone else who had the same reaction?	-10
13290	"prescribed for add and excessive daytime sleepiness. very good at helping me focus when i need it. it also works too well for my fatigue, i went from feeling like a narcoleptic to having insomnia. i had to cut back on my prescribed dose because it was too much. i take only 5mg when i need it. even though this medication will wake you up, you absolutely must manage your time and get some quality sleep, because most side effects come from lack of sleep. be careful with this as it can be habit forming and addictive. the key is to eat well and sleep well when on this medication."	-10
12321	"it was great to bring the viral load quickly to undetectable but otherwise it was not a great experience. was on it for about 8 months.. head aches, fatigue, weirdest dreams, irritability, depression and almost commit suicide. got off that drug and a few days later i started to feel like myself again..."	-10
151267	"first of all, all of those people who quit, will be back to smoking really soon. and if it says they are smoke free for years, it is probably a bought comment by pfizer. trust me. i did quit as well 3 times, but it is not permanent. the side effects last even months after you take the pill. the last time i quit with it, i had a neurological breakdown, i could not control my body, i was having a non fatal stroke and even heart attack. i could not talk, had to be taken to the emergency. my eyes were rolling up, i could not control my limbs, could not talk, my mouth would not move to talk. it was horrible. months later i am back to smoking and now i am scared to take the pill. the depression was horrific and same with the dreams. i do not recommend"	-10
188723	"i just got paragard not too long ago. and it was actually not as bad as i thought it would be. there was not excruciating pain at all. just cramping. anyone wanting to get it should most definitely do so. it's not as bad as some may say, but everyone reacts to things differently."	-10
205573	i have taken pristiq for 2 weeks and it is starting to help my mood and energy level. i am so happy as this gives me hope that i can get back to normal.	-10
111083	"this is my second time trying verapamil. neither time was effective. side effects were unacceptable (leg pain, increased dizziness, non migraine headaches)."	-10
211361	i took myrbetriq for 4 months for treatment of severe overactive bladder. it helped me only slightly and the side effects for me would have caused me to stop taking it even if it had been 100% helpful. it immediately spiked my blood pressure to an average of 180/110 and my blood pressure returned to normal as soon as i stopped taking it. it also caused me bladder pain which i can best describe as feeling like my bladder was filled with shards of broken glass whenever my bladder got full. i also had difficulty emptying my bladder. i wanted this to work but unfortunately it did not for me.	-10
219771	"i was diagnosed with ic shortly after the birth of my second son, in 1998. tried elmiron and it did nothing to help with the pain or urgency. i spent about 8 months thinking i had frequent uti's, before diagnosing this correctly. once i went on the elavil, and changed my diet, my symptoms improved dramatically and quickly. it worked very well. after about 10 years, i decided to wean myself off of it and see if i could live without the medication and just watch my diet. i was good for about a month. the awful pain and urgency came back with a vengence. i was in tears. as soon as i went back on the elavil, within 1 day i was feeling almost completely normal again. i am resigned to being on 25 mg daily of elavil for life."	-10
179946	"i started using epiduo and it was working perfectly. then one day around my eyebrows started to hurt then the next day the skin was peeling. it wasn't sunburn for sure because there was no sunshine for days. i put the lotion on it and it stung. three days later my skin is still peeling, it hurts when i touch it, and my acne is back."	-10
141485	"took 10mg last night for the first time. felt drowsy after an hour. thought this was a good thing because i have trouble sleeping, but when i went to bed and started my usual worries, my heart started pounding in my throat and i felt like i couldn't breath deep enough. it was a struggle to sleep all night and woke up from weird dreams at 3am and was wide awake. it is now almost 11 and i feel like i am trembling internally. i will not be continuing this medication. i wonder if it is because it is a generic? i have heard patients have more issue with generics."	-10
161489	"have been taking this for not even a month and i have been super emotional, its crazy because i'm usually layed back. i want sex more now but i guess you can say i experience a little cramping sharp pains every now and then. overall its okay."	-10
6064	"my gyn prescribed this pill to help with my heavy periods. i hate it! i've been on it for almost 2 months, i take it at the exact same time everyday, and have never missed a dose. i have had the worse mood swings and have been bleeding for a whole month. i experienced what i would call a very heavy period (changing my pad every 45 min or wearing adult diapers) 2 times in one month and the cramps are horrible. i went in to to see my dr the second time i experienced the heavy bleeding and she said that this is normal for the first 3-4 months of taking this med. i wish that i had never started this medication. my periods were heavy before the pill and now they are worse than before. at least before the pill i only bled 8 days out of the month."	-10
150912	"i was prescribed bactrim for a bacterial skin infection under my arm. i get infections easily and am often on all kinds of antibiotics. many bother me, but i have not had any problems at all while on bactrim. and the skin infection has been clearing up very well (i'm almost done with the medication.) i'm very happy with this medication."	-10
96623	i have been taking this for two years now. at first i was taking 50mg but now i'm taking 150mg once a day and it has really helped with my depression along with other issues.	-10
7115	"i used to sweat under the arms excessively. all my tee shirts had yellow stains. my doctor prescribed this once back in 2000. yes it burned somewhat, but it totally stopped the underarm perspiration. i haven't sweated under my arms much since about the end of 2000. i had the prescription renewed in june 2001, and that bottle is still half full, since i have totally stopped underarm perspiration, and i haven't had to use it in 11 years!"	-10
179778	"i started about a month ago, it seems to be taking a long while to start showing any difference. if anything my acne is getting worse, but in new spots. also i can't use it every night at directed because the dryness, and burning is too much to handle. literally tearing up pain. i'll update again if it starts doing its job :("	-10
80307	"i finally found something that worked for me- before i was having difficulty finding the right dose- now that they no longer make it, i am have a difficult time taking the generic due to the noticeable side effects- but the alternatives do not work either."	-10
69333	"my second try to share what happened to me after trying this rx. i have a nerve injury in my face and use oxycodone as needed. i tried this patch and after a few hours my voice became hoarse, nose plugged, sore throat and minor wheezing. i applied this to my right shoulder and my armpit swelled and became very painful! after searching symptoms i found a long word that meant my lymph node had swollen and was painful! i find it hard to believe that this thing would help anybody's pain."	-10
144348	"i got the nexplanon implant because my periods would come with extreme cramps that put me down for 4-5 days. i would sleep all the time and couldn't help but to cry because i was in so much pain. so, my ob suggested a birth control and i heard really bad things about the depo shot so i didn't want that &amp; i hadn't heard anything bad about the implant. so i went with it rather than the shot. i had the implant for three months. in the time that i had it, i had nothing but horrific migraines, cramping and i bled for 3 weeks, stopped for 6 days, &amp; now i've been bleeding for 30 days. i've had a headache since 2-1-16. i am an emotional wreck. i cry at the stupidest things and i get upset over nothing. i highly recommend not getting this implant."	-10
16880	"i'm a 43 yr old healthy female who has had recent spinal disc degeneration so pain has been tough. sleep was always elusive a bit except when exercise a big part of my life; now sleep has gotten more unobtainable. i used to get rx ambien but as predicted, it stopped working quickly with tolerance (non-addictive like unisom, but habit-forming and awful on memory - be wary of zolpidem/ambien.) unisom and its generic have contributed to depression and ill feelings. i think this is quite literally as the bottle reads, for occasional sleeplessness. wishing it worked more regularly."	-10
44494	"i have been on ortho tri cyclin lo on and off for 2 years now and haven't had a problem. my insurance switched me to this medication and i've had nothing but problems with it. nausea and headaches, my periods have been up to two weeks longs and i've had much pain during the time of them. you should try it for yourself but for me it wasn't good and i took it for 4 months. the doctor had me stay on to see if it got better and it hasn't so i was forced to switch to something else."	-10
118546	"hate this treatment. i had pylori for about 3 months before being diagnosed through a poop test. i'm on one 20mg nexium, two 500mg amoxi and one 500mg klacid twice a day. it really does suck. i'm on day 7 of 7 thankfully. my ass of a doctor never told me to keep up the good bacteria, he told me to stop with the probiotics. i've had insomnia, random violent nausea, pretty bad abdominal pain, battery acid taste that never goes away and it feels like i'm breathing out ammonia! chills, fever, body pain and if your a woman, well yea, that side effect too. if this doesn't cure the h pylori then, they can stay there"	-10

217169	a very large meningioma next to my pituitary gland damaged the pituitary and lessened the production of several hormones including growth hormone. this is a rare disorder and i had difficulty finding an endocrinologist who could diagnose the problem much less know how to treat it but was finally successful in finding a doctor who diagnosed my problem and prescribed omnitrrope for me. after taking the medicine for four days my strength improved considerably. that was three years ago and i continue to use the medicine. i am confident it saved my life.	-10
98422	"my experience with nexplanon was horrible and would like to share my experience, although everyone is different and what doesn't work for me might work for you or vice versa. i had the nexplanon placed 3 months after giving birth. before that i was happy, high sex drive (always have had high sex drive), regular periods, and overall very long life. after nexplanon i had non stop bleeding, severe headaches, severe dizziness, severe lightheadedness, extreme fatigue and severe mood swings. i felt like i was going downhill because i felt sick all the time and extreme sadness and depression. i had it removed because i no longer felt like myself and felt like i was making bad memories on what should be my most precious moments with my family."	-10
2996	can't even explain how bad this made me feel. seriously thought i was dying. chills...sweating ...throwing up...i actually passed out on my bathroom bath. my chest pain was so bad i thought i was having a heart attack. no desire to eat...i've never had a problem with meds like this before in my life. never again. i took it for 2 days and stopped. be cautious.	-10
64535	"having felt sick for the better part of the last year, many side effects of pain in my neck due to 3 bulging discs, i was recently hospitalized with heart palpitations but nothing seems to be wrong with my heart. my doctor thought i may be having depression due to all my physical pain. she started me on 25 mg of zoloft two weeks ago and increased it to 50 mg today. i'm feeling a positive change already. not dwelling on my feelings of pain and sickness. i will continue zoloft as the side effects are minimal compared to the benefits"	-10
179991	"my dr prescribed me different creams &amp; pills but nothing helped to clear my acne. my dr then sent me to a dermatologist who prescribed me epiduo cream. it took around 3wks before i started noticing the changes. using the cream burnt my face a little bit in the first wk but has not done it since. i have now been using epiduo for almost a yr. my face has never been so clear, and very rarely do i get a pimple. i found the best way for it work for me, is i shower ever night &amp; only wash my face with gold bar soap. i then dry my face &amp; apply the epiduo very sparingly. when i wake in the morning, i use a flannel and wash my face. i do not use any creams, makeup or moisturier."	-10
79100	"i had sex with a condom, he took it off in between, and then put on another one. ultimately, he came into the condom, but i was worried about precum. i think it was also the time i was ovulating. i took plan b one step 26 hours after and i'm 160 lbs. i got my period around two weeks later and have an irregular cycle. it was spotting for for like 5 hours that morning/afternoon and then i got my period normally that night. it lasted about 6 days, as usual. the only symptoms i felt were nausea for one day a few days after i took the pill, bloating, and really bad acne. my face has breakouts all over it and it's been almost 2 months. i just got my second period since the pill now that it is march, so it surely worked. bad acne though."	-10

65329	"i love how yasmin clears my acne up without fail (usually within first week). however, second month in and i've experienced terrible depression and feel teary at the slightest things. feeling down is getting worse and worse as i continue taking it and i'm actually a very happy person which is why i will never touch this stuff again."	-10
109789	hate this. i've been on this birth control for one year now. i gave it a chance. i have been bleeding for 9 out of the 12 months. two weeks after i got it i had massive depression that lasted for 2 weeks. i guess it was my hormones changing. then nonstop bleeding and cramps. sometimes they were very light but it was extremely annoying and expense to be buying so many tampons. i also gained about 15 pound over the last year and i work out and don't over eat. its very difficult trying to get the weight off. don't use this. your doctor will say its great and you won't have to worry about taking a pill every day. don't do it...its a trap.	-10
110587	i have moderate lower back pain and my doctor suggested i take lorzone in case i have muscle spasm. well i took the lorzone 750mg and i had no side effects whatsoever (which is good) yet the pain is still there. i have an appointment for mri soon. hope i find out what is causing my pain.	-10

179146	"i developed an illness that evolved in stages. a few stages in i lost the ability to sleep naturally. this was about eleven years ago. a few years went by trying every sleep med with utter failure. ambien, lunesta, benzodiazepines, trazadone, most atypical antipsychotics. eventually a new lifestyle evolved where i would be up for near three days straight then sleep for a full day, repeat. what finally put me to sleep was a little risperidone and a megadose of seroquel. risperdal &quot;allowed&quot; me to fall asleep, while max dose of seroquel &quot;kept me in sleeping state &quot;long enough&quot; and &quot;deep enough.&quot; 3am now, tried 10mg of zyprexa an hour ago alone, its barely affecting me. remeron with halved seroquel/risperdal, put me down great."	-10
105906	"i'm a 30 year old male and switched from dexedrine to strattera about two years ago. for the first two months i thought it was a terrible decision because of the horrible side effects and talked to my doctor a couple of times about switching back to a stimulant. he told me that even though it says it can take up to a month to start working, in his experience, it took most patients 2-3 months to see the benefits. i'm glad i stuck with it. after four months all side effects we're completely gone and it works better than any stimulant type i've been prescribed. the problem is you do have to get through a horrible period of 1-3 months (10 weeks for me) before the nausea, fatigue, ed and insane sweating are gone. this drug takes time to work!!!"	-10
230600	"the first three months went alright- i was quite moody and emotional, but nothing more than how i am when i get pms. it was bearable and didn't last too long. i had one period for two weeks. after taking the second shot, i have had a period for over a month and a half now (an actual heavy period, not spotting). my acne has gotten worse. i'm definitely switching to the pill when i am ready to get my next shot."	-10
160912	"i can't lose any weight on this medication. i hate it. this manufacturer should make a medication with a weight loss additive in it. some poor people want to lose weight, this medication makes it impossible."	-10
180490	have been using pennsaid for over eight years but strictly on an as needed basis (2-3) times a week. very effective for knees and hips (almost instant relief). only side effect is an occasional oral off taste.	-10
73233	"the first night i took this pill i got the worst headache that woke me up, followed by severe nausea and vomiting. hours later my left arm went numb and i had to go to the urgent care. it was so scary! if this happens to you- stop taking it!"	-10
141776	had to put up with 1 am awakenings for the first few months on this medicine but it is good from anxiety/social anxiety. no other side effects and seems helpful.	-10
184221	"just woke up from sleep, for the 6th time in the space of an hour. this thing give me weird dreams, and i'm not joking by that. i almost felt i was developing schizophrenia. it seems to blur the distinction between the dream state and reality: i was asleep but i could still move, although in a very slow, paralyzed manner. the interactions with people in my dreams were insanely vivid. this is not the first time, but the dreams have never been this wild! tired, but scared to go back to sleep. oh, it does help with slowing down the body and relaxing muscle, but it seems to wear off as quickly as it sets on."	-10
50331	"started taking this for hot flashes a couple of weeks ago. i'm on 300mg twice a day and it is wonderful. i would sometimes get more than 4 hot flashes per hour- i felt like a chameleon. i had no idea how nice it is to be almost completely hot flash free! i'm post menopause at 48 and started having flashes at 37. after awhile it becomes a fact of life, if i had under 10 flashes in a day i thought that was good. when i started having 2-4 per hour in the afternoons, sometimes more than 30 during waking hours, my oncologist prescribed this. i can't take hormones because of high risk breast cancer. gabapentin is giving me my life back!!!!!"	-10
67523	"i have started vimpat just over 7 days ago and noticed i feel like losing marbles. i can't think straight, i can't concentrate on anything, can't read anything as can't concentrate long enough to read it. i get really dizzy, i'm forgetting lots, even walked out forgetting hadn't put shoes on. i was only started on 50mg one a day and within 7 days thinking it's making me a nutter."	-10
175746	"i have pneumonia in both lungs for the second time in 35 days. i was hospitalized this time though, so it's definitely worse the the first illness. the only side effect i've noticed is nausea. if i drink water quickly, i immediately feel the need to throw up. problem is that i'm always thirsty. i am home now thank goodness, still sick but i have what i need. i left ama because i've got four kids with christmas on their brains. hopefully my pills will do the trick."	-10
220710	"i'm 20 years old and had always experienced severe cramps and bleeding for as long as i've had my period. i also suffered from severe acne. since i've started loestrin 24, i noticed dramatic changes in every aspect! -my periods are lighter (1-2 days) -my skin is flawless -i lost about 7 lbs! -overall i feel my hormones regulated and less moody loestrin 24 really turned my life around and i couldn't be happier! i hope you all have the same experience with it."	-10
129359	"today is the day after insertion for mirena (first time user) and have 3 kids. in advance, the doctor's office told me to take 2 advil before arriving at appointment. i barely felt the insertion and had to ask if it was inserted. i felt an ever so slight cramping for 2 hours afterwards (maybe because i was very aware of it and looking for some symptom) and then haven't felt anything since that time yesterday. i have a small amount of spotting (using a small pantyliner, but not enough for a pad). the doctor called to follow up today and stated some women do not have discomfort, especially after having 3 kids but to call back if i had any questions. i will update a review if any issues arise but wanted to post b/c read all experiences!!"	-10
88511	"i was having probably my 10th colonoscopy and the dr prescribed this. what a joke. i have had ibs and uncontrollable diarrhea for the past 2.5 months. all this stuff did was constipate me! i was shocked when the dr came out afterwards and said they had to abort the procedure! i was completely blocked after 2 days of liquid diet and taking the two doses of prepopik plus all the water you have to drink after each dose. two days prior i was having constant diarrhea days prior to this. i don't know what kind of snake oil this is, but it is unfair to paitients, esp, when their procedure has to be aborted!"	-10
116196	"i started amolodopine/besylate in august of 2011. i switch from lisinopril as i was having severe allergic reactions. now i'm on this new medication and i have been feeling unusual at times. i feel very dizzy, swelling in hands, feet and throat area. i've had a throat infection and sometimes i feel like i'm limited in my speech. i'm experiencing tingling in my hands and feet at times. it's annoying. my blood pressure is lowering now because i've increased my exercise, but sometimes i'm not able to drive home because of the dizziness. i've had one crazy episode when i took a multivitamin. i felt my heart beating so fast and i could literally hear it through my ears. i was unable to pay attention and was jittery and cold."	-10
40950	"generic drugs can be produced by several different pharmaceutical manufacturers and more than likely, if you look up the ingredients from each one, you will find that they all use different binders/fillers and such. because of this, your experience with these drugs may include nausea, nervousness, upset stomach, etc. so my suggestion is that if you take a generic drug and are having problems or it isn't &quot;doing what it's supposed to do&quot; you may want to ask your pharmacist to change suppliers for you. in regard to generic percocet, i had this problem. yes, they did relieve my pain but some did it better than others and several made me 'nervous' and gave me an upset stomach. most pharmacist's are aware of this difference."	-10
54753	"so i started on contrave on march 20th. before i was on wellbutrin for many years and since the wellbutrin is in contrave, my doctor had me discontinue the wellbutrin when i started. with this in mind my doctor had me start my 1st day with 1 in the am and 1 in the pm. so now i am at 2 and 2 a day. the 1st week i was super hungry, 2 week i was extremely nauseous​ with no cravings and fuller but i still wanted to eat. i am gaining weight and have extreme constipation. i regularly take linzess and senekot for this and it doesn't help. can anyone relate? will it get better?"	-10

156765	"come off bydureon from terrible side effects but my a1c was so much better with it, i asked my doctor for another try with a similar product. prescribed trulicity, after the 3-4th week on the full recommended dosage, i have been managing much better glucose results, my a1c has improved and happy with the results. side effects were minimal and i did lose a few pounds the first few weeks but nothing that watching your food intake couldn't do."	-10
226039	"wellbutrin xl is the only medication for depression i have taken that doesn't cause any side effects as far as i can tell, but still produces the desired results. (according to my wife, children, and close friends.) that makes it the right medication for me."	-10
23755	"after three days use i started having large red bumps on the back of my hair line and on my neck. also chest pain the three nights. i stopped using it then, hopefully it will be corrected in a few days."	-10
42937	"i love the patch. i was on the depo and it made me miserable. i was bleeding for 3 months straight till' i switch to xulane. this will be my third month using the patch and the only con is the nausea, skin irritation around the area and having to reapply it because of clothes or showering. i have gained weight, that i don't mind but i can't stop eating! i plan on staying with the patch. highly recommend."	-10
17797	"i was on nuvaring for about six months. for the first month or two, i had terrible headaches at the end of the days i had class, but everything else was fine. fast forward to 3-5 months, i was moody, i was even a little depressed, and i had no sex drive. i wanted to eat everything in sight. from the second month to the sixth month, i gained about twenty pounds with no significant lifestyle changes or dietary changes besides the nuvaring. if you are tolerant of high hormone levels and don't gain weight, this might be a good option for you. it stays in for three weeks and comes out the fourth week for your period (which mine came very regularly while on it). if it wasn't for the significant weight gain, i would have stayed on it."	-10
222128	"i use rozerem as a back up when my halcion stops working due to overuse. i find that the rozerem definitely knocks me out for a good number of hours. the only side effect is the feeling of a mild hangover in the morning. but overall, it is a good back up to have in your arsenal when you suffer from severe insomnia as i do."	-10
137786	"i am so lucky i live in denmark where it is free to get all kinds of medicines. enbrel has been working quite well actually for the past 2.5 year, but recently my doctor recommend me to get out of it, and i started by pushing it with 3 days, and the 3 days made my knees swell up. now i am back with the 7 days interval, but it wont really help as much as before. so, i guess it was too soon to get out of using it."	-10

203209	"i recently posted a review on this pill 3 months ago when i fist started and thought it was great. i was wrong! i had to update because i could not in good conscience let anyone think this pill is anything but terrible. my fist month went great, no side effects at all. the second month i noticed my stomach was not right. turns out this pill destroys the good bacteria in your gut. probiotics are a must! i noticed i started to gain a little weight and developed slight eczema on my face which still comes and goes 2 months later. beware taking this pill."	-10
201292	"my husband has had depression and at times severe anxiety for years. he would have anxiety attacks so bad he was sure he was having a full blown heart attack every time, and his anxiety prevented him from sleeping because he was sure he would die in his sleep. his depression was bad as well, he was sure the world would be better off without him. he tried different medications but nothing really worked, some seemed to improve things a little bit but for the most part i had given up hope that any of them really do much. then he tried zoloft. for him, this was the one. it took the edge off after about a week, after two weeks i could definitely tell a difference. after about 6 weeks he was back to his normal self."	-10

90694	"i've been taken chateal for 7 months now. it's been effective the whole time i've been on it but it's been a horrible experience overall. it did not help with my period in any way. my periods are still the same length, they're heavier and my cramps are worse. acne never played a part in this as a side effect since i've never had a problem with acne. taking chateal literally made me feel insane. i have never in my life felt so sad and angry and depressed for no reason. i used to only cry getting close to my period and now i cry all the time the whole month about anything. i constantly felt depressed without a way out because i couldn't figure out why i felt this way. no one should have to feel this way."	-10

26482	"i've been taking this birth control for 5 years and love it. i never had any side effects. i took loestrin first and hated it, bad mood swings and increased appetite so i immediately switched to sprintec and was completely happy. i recently had to switch to a new pill due to spotting between periods."	-10

84395	"awful. i had fairly clear skin before taking sprintec and had gotten the implant taken out a couple months prior. but within less than a month i began to see my face break out on sprintec. it eventually developed to the point where i got hormonal acne on my forehead and chin, places i had never gotten acne. i stayed on the pill for 3 months and couldn't take the acne any more, and the worst part is that the acne worsened after i got off. it has been four months and my face is filled with acne scars and new blemishes. this has been an ongoing battle for me, and i regret taking the pill. immensely. please avoid this at all costs! especially if you have sensitive skin or acne free skin to begin with! i'd give anything to have my old face back."	-10
219153	"i wrote back in may and wanted to follow up since it has now been 4 months. my allergist was a bit disappointed as i still have some eczema -- i am about 70 percent clearer. i haven't been using any steroid creams so maybe with those we would see better results. i did go through a crazy flaky period on my face/scalp/arms. i finally used some tar shampoo and tea tree oil to get through that it lasted a good 8 to 10 weeks. my skin does feel much softer, my husband has commented several times. i think the most noticeable thing for me is the itch is gone. that alone is worth the shots to me. i wish i had better luck with clearer skin. we don't realize how much we scratch ourselves without even thinking, until we stop."	-10

199008	"warning! i received two injections, and it was the worst 6 months of my life. this should come with explicit warnings, but didn't. i came down with severe anxiety and depression. my life fell apart and i had to leave town to regroup. my interpersonal relationships unravelled. i was so depressed i couldn't move. i saw a pyschiatrist and he suggested that the depression could very well have been due to the depo shot - he's seen it affect others like this as well. also, i rapidly gained 15-20 lbs. it's been 8 months since my last injection and i am ecstatic to report my period finally came back. it can take that long to leave the system! this is a dangerous drug. monitor your mental health closely. in fact don't do it"	-10
68861	"my teenage daughter (17 yrs) got the shot 3 weeks ago and it has been devastating. has caused her personality changes, she is dangerously impulsive, gets angry in a few seconds which has never been like her. she eats constantly as she says she is always hungry. it has caused her to have horrible judgement and because of the shot she has had to go into therapy to teach her coping skills. i would never recommend it to anyone."	-10
46353	"provigil worked for my narcolepsy for about 6 months. after that, i began to have bouts of insomnia at night and became ultra sleepy during the day times. i was prescribed sleep medications to help combat the new side effects. things did not seem to improve. i also gained 40 pounds during the time i took provigil (which was a total of 9 months). as a woman, gaining weight was my least desirable side effect of all. finally, i switched off of provigil and returned to what was working for me originally, adderall xr 30 mg one to two times per day (depending on what my schedule was like that day). i only switched off of adderall xr originally because my doctor was concerned about the potential long term cardiovascular effects on my body."	-10
14376	"suboxone changed my life. this drug is in a class by itself. i have had no real side effects while on this. i've been on it for almost a year and never have the cravings to use anything. if you are looking into treatment take this route not methadone. i was on methadone 4 years and found myself relapsing all the time. if you are currently on methadone and are wanting to switch talk to your doctor because suboxone will throw you into a severe withdrawal when taking after, even days after your last dose. they will know how to do it. overall this drug has single-handedly changed my path to becoming sober. good luck in your recovery!"	-10

172246	"this is a great drug but you have to be disciplined with it. it's not a cure, only an aid. writing this review in april 2017, i've been on it for a month shy of ten years. i started at 0.5 mg twice a day and that's the dose i'm still on. you have to resist the urge to increase the dose and instead work on yourself. there will be bad times...you just have to accept that and work to minimize them. and don't drink on clonazepam. it multiplies the effect of alcohol to an astounding degree and i find it to be extremely unpleasant. giving up drinking even socially wasn't hard, though when i refuse drinks people assume i'm a recovering alcoholic. even nursing a single bourbon and coke will get me pretty sloppy...it's just not worth it."	-10

231135	the drops worked okay but i started to notice joint pain in my hands and legs. my legs have an almost a restless legs feeling. i stopped the drops for a few days and everything went away. started the drops again yesterday and woke up right back with the pains and tingling. i'm supposed to use the drops 4x a day. i have no clue why the drops would cause these affects but wanted to share in case someone else might have the same problem.	-10
74421	"i just started taking this pill 12 days ago. i just got my period, which i shouldn't get for another 12 days, with or without taking a birth control pill. this is not &quot;spotting.&quot; i also have been way oversensitive and crying about things for the past few days. i was given this pill to manage my pms emotions. it's not exactly working out."	-10
108858	"i've had nexplanon for a little over 2 months now and i'm almost 4 months postpartum. the past two months have been the worst. i'm always moody, can't control my attitude. the bleeding has been horrible and basically nonstop. in two months i have gone a total of 4 days without bleeding. i went through a pack and a half of pads in a week. dropped from a size 14 to a size 9 in a week cause i had no will to eat. my arm burns at random. i have developed random numbness in my arm and the occasional chest pain along with a constant headache. i go the 29th for a consultation about having it removed. i would honestly rather swap to a different birth control and take my chances with getting pregnant again then stay on this."	-10
226430	i hate it so much! i've had it for a year now i was really into track and i'm a vegan. i take care of my body. i've been at a healthy weight most of my life but after getting this bar i've gained 45lb and the only thing that has changed in my routine is this birth control. i'm getting it removed asap. my doctor kept telling me let my body adjust to it after 9 months i waited 12! my doctor keeps trying to blame me for the weight gain but i eat between 900-1200cal a day and it's mostly vegetables or tofu!	-10
127751	"i am 28, 5 ft 7in and my starting weight was 298lbs. i have always looked smaller than i weighed. i started taking phentermine 01/19/2017. i work out every other day for four hours. i mostly do cardio between treadmill, elliptical, stair climber, and arc trainer. depending on the day i will only use two different cardio machines. then utilize the weight lifting machines to tighten and tone. had my first weigh in yesterday and i was down 20.8 lbs. my goal was 10. this has def helped me get my eating under control and i have more energy as well. the only problem i face is severe dry mouth which water will fix or even chewing gum. i would recommend this as a starting point to lose weight. i didn't get a refill as per my request."	-10
100564	"i was on marvelon for 2 years, and then switched to apri after losing my &quot;student&quot; status, and therefore needed a cheaper pill. i've been on it for 4 months, and although my periods are regular, the side effects are horrible. i have noticed frequent headaches, at least a 15 pound weight gain, and zero sex drive. i eat healthy and started exercising, not realizing why i was gaining and keeping all this weight. it's not going anywhere. the zero sex drive is not like me, and has affected my relationship. all of these side effects have been occurring since being on apri. it may work for some people, but i'd gladly pay the extra for marvelon in order to have these effects go away."	-10
154697	"i actually feel as though i'm dying right now. my stomach is extremely bloated and painful, has been for the last few hours i've also been vomiting. i spoke to a doc who told me yes it sounds like side effects from this tablet. not happy as i'm in so much discomfort right now."	-10
157132	"this gel has been horrific for my skin. as a result of taking it i have come up with an allergic reaction on my neck and around my eyes which is so painful, itchy and red. i really wouldn't recommend trying it unless you are really desperate. i have read a lot of other reviews where people said this happened to them too - but the gp never informed me of the potential side effects."	-10
208528	"after 3 1/2 months of using limbrel i became vilolently ill. i had extreme nausea, vomiting, feverish, chills, achy. my primary doctor ran blood work and it came back that i was anemic with liver problems. after 15 days of feeling like i had food poisoning, i searched online and found that there were dozens of people with the same symptoms and some even went to the hospital. i stopped taking the limbrel right away and started feeling better within 48 hrs. after 7-8 days i was back to 100%."	-10
60222	"when i was on the pill, i had a hard time remembering to take it. my dr. told me to try the nuvaring since it was easier to remember. i have now been on it for a year, and i must say; it is a lot easier to remember to change once a month instead of taking a pill everyday. what makes my score not a 10 is the fact that it has dramatically killed my sex drive. i am at the point where i don't want sex at all and that is affecting my marriage. it has also messed with my energy; it has made me tired all day. i go to bed beyond exhausted and wake up tired. if it wasn't for those two side effects i would stay on it. i am about to make my yearly &quot;check up&quot; and my going to ask my dr. about the patch....i've heard good things about it."	-10

24090	"i am 27 and have always suffered from acne. i tried everything and was always disappointed as my breakouts continued. after a short stint with spironolactone, my dermatologist said she wanted me on a topical and introduced me to atralin. it took my skin a few weeks to get used to and probably 2 months for my breakouts to completely clear up. i haven't had a pimple in months. i finally feel comfortable enough to wear my hair up in public and can even go with no makeup. great skin can really change your life!"	-10
164422	"voltaren gel has given me back the ability to walk without pain. i have had heel spurs and plantar fasciitis and bursitis in my heel for about 20 years. i began using voltaren gel about 10 months ago and am so thankful that i have not had any significant pain for the past six months. i also try to wear only shoes that have very high arches. with the voltaren gel, i massage it all around my foot and over the top and bottom as per the directions. great stuff!!!"	-10
49080	"so i have irregular periods and decided to get back on bc to regulate them... i'm on day 11 of aviane and it is the absolute worst!!!!!!!!! i started spotting within a day of taking the pill... i figured since it been a while that was normal. ugh. then started a full blown period the next day and it hasn't gone away. i missed one dosage and that lightened it up, but now that i'm taking it reguarly again it's a heavy cycle again. also i've vomitted once and have been consistently nauseous and have headaches all day. i try to drink water and eat but nothing is helping, but laying down and i can't do that all day. my mood is ridiculous. i cry about everything now. i cried because the sun was out and it was beautiful smh. i would say stay away!"	-10
73969	"after trying several different birth control options (pill/iud) this is by far the best one so far ... i've been taking it for a little over 4 years and it is very effective with minimal side effects - mostly physical symptoms like slight dizziness from time to time and slight discoloration on my face which is easily covered with powder. over the course of the last year or two, my periods went from your average 5 to 7 day period to a very nice 3 day, very light period."	-10

127600	i'm 44 years old and only 5 feet tall and have struggled with my weight for over a decade. i'm currently at my heaviest at 250 pounds. i was so small in high school - college 100 pounds. a friend at work lost 31 pounds on it in just 3 months. i asked him how he did it and he told me about it. i went to his doctor since my doc never told me about this miracle of a pill and i just started it today. i've read a lot of great comments about it. i do have borderline blood pressure to start with so was told to check my bp on it daily. i took one full 37.5 pill at 10 a.m. i about 2 -3 hours later i felt a little dizzy. around 7 pm i've had stomach upset. i'm praying i loose weight on this.	-10
14001	"got to say that this medicine was worth it so much. i was put on megestrol 20 mg for 20 days and i had no side effect to this medicine. i started taking it and by the 5th day the heavy bleeding had stop. this is the second time being put on megestrol 20mg. i know everybody has a different opinion on this medication, and for what's it worth i'm happy with the outcome every single time."	-10
90913	"i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about seven years ago. i have taken norco as prescribed by my physician along with other medications. norco has improved my quality of life 100% as it allows me to manage down my pain level so that i am capable of conducting everyday living without that heavy narcotic side effects i.e., feeling &quot;high&quot;, sleepiness, nausea, abdominal discomfort. i think i have developed a mild physical or mental dependence due to the length of time that i've been on the medicine. first and foremost i take the medicine as directed and i do not wait until my pain level is at a 10 before i act otherwise it's effects are limited. norco has been very helpful in giving me my like back!"	-10

189808	"i have struggled with bipolar depression with psychotic features for years. i have tried around 30 medications and with no results. my doctor decided to try chlorpromazine to help. the honest truth is its a life saver. not only do i sleep 8 hours of restful deep sleep, i wake up every morning happy and ready to take on the day. it has helped my depression tremendously, and has helped eliminate my psychotic features. the only side effects i have is drowsiness and dizziness, but nothing i can't handle. i take 200 mg at bedtime, and will soon ask to raise it to 300 mg. my advice is if you want to be happy, healthy, and sleep great, chlorpromazine is a miracle drug and i could not be more satisfied."	-10
173386	"i went through a weight loss program at my local hospital (protein shakes, healthy meal) i lost 48 pounds met my goal august, 2015. throughout my program and presently if i have a fatty meal i take an alli maybe one every other day. it is amazing for weight loss maintenance in the past the pounds would be creeping i keep things in check but it is wonderful to occasionally have a treat. highly recommend for post weight loss maintenance."	-10
101952	"this is my second time around for taking this medicine. the first occasion (about 14 years ago) after taking it for 3 weeks, i completely lost my sense of taste &amp; lost half a stone in weight - it took three weeks after stopping the medication for my taste buds to work again. believe me there is no pleasure in eating when you cannot taste anything!! when i was told i needed anti fungul treatment again recently i asked my gp to check the name of the drug i was given before, they couldn't find a record of it!! so i have been on this for three weeks &amp; guess what, i have lost my sense of taste again, i also have a most awful taste in my mouth that i cannot get rid of - i have stopped taking them and will have to use an alternative treatment."	-10

119040	"this medication has worked wonders for me. for years i have been plagued with constant worry, fear of social situations, anxiety and panic attacks. i started taking this medication after the loss of a loved one as all of the above symtoms were spiraling out of control. what a change! i have been taking it for about seven months with no side effects."	-10
118506	"i am on my third week, 20mlgm first two now 40. doc plans on two weeks at 40 then 80. i:m not sure if i will stay there or what just yet. the only side effect thus far was about a week of lightheadedness upon rising, which has since subsided. i do believe the depression doesn't feel quit as heavy and the three hours i do sleep were better sounder sleep. i have tried everything there is and this is wook for a whole then side effects outweigh bennifit or just stop working. i am hoping that the seemingly quick response continues. this could be the one. hopefully the saratonin reuptake adds to it's effectiveness. waiting to see../"	-10
181946	"i took this for 6 months. it does a pretty good job at clearing up my skin but occasionally i get large single zits once in a while. i did not experience any bad moods, fatigue, or weight gain as with other pills so azurette is the most tolerable pill by far for me. but it causes so much hair loss i need to switch to a different pill."	-10

27605	"so far, so good! i've had rosacea for over 20 years. i've had good days and bad days. it seemed like the bad days were coming more often, my confidence level plummeted, and the disease was affecting me at work, socially, etc. i was hesitant to try anything new from my dermatologist as it seemed like nothing was working. i figured that i had nothing to lose trying the soolantra, as my doctor provided me with a few samples. within days of using the soolantra, my face looked and felt great! i've been using it for about a month now with glowing (pun intended) results. i look and feel fabulous. kudos to soolantra!"	-10
126987	"due to chronic pain i take a lot of meds to begin with. i ended up in the hospital with a severe migraine that i'd already had for a few days (among other things). morphine wasn't helping, not even dilauded helped. i don't know who made the switch, but finally at the end of the second day a nurse came in to give me the raglan, toradol, benadryl combo. oh how i loved her after that. it burned slightly going into my iv (but potassium burned a hell of a lot more) but that was really it. i didn't feel jittery but it's the usual initial feeling of light-headedness and warmth. it didn't last long and within a few minutes my head was starting to feel better. i was surprised this worked so well."	-10
36218	so i got diagnosed about 3 months ago and it sucks because i've only ever had 2 partners. anyways i started using the vyloma my doctor prescribed and all i can tell you is that it made deep ulcers on my uvula and around my urethra. i was in so much pain! it did absolutely nothing for the warts! so he gave me a stronger dose... not sure if he knows what he's doing.	-10
187140	"i started taking this birth control a while back and then stopped after i completed one cycle. i did have a little weight gain because of the carbohydrate cravings. breast tenderness and bloating were also a factor. those were my negatives. the positives for me were age related. i am over 35 and a non-smoker. therefore, the extra vitamin b and folic acid supplements are excellent. i did stop taking them after the first trial because of the food cravings. after a few months, i decided to try them again. i am on a weight loss plan and have loss weight. i wasn't significantly overweight from the beginning, but needed to drop about fifteen pounds. i reached my goal. my only real concern at this point is will i have the cravings."	-10
142591	"i had protected sex, but the condom broke. i didn't know until i saw a piece of the condom 24 hours later. i took next choice about 12 hours later (36 hours?) of the incident. i got my period 5 days early. my only side effects were headaches."	-10
15409	"i wanted to write a review because i see so many people saying it caused them side effects, so i wanted to share a positve review so potential users aren't afraid to try it. i had no side effects whatsoever from this drug. i've been on it for 8 years and haven't gotten pregnant so it is definitely effective. and a bonus has been much lighter periods."	-10
72708	"i've been on this birth control for 2 years now. just recently, the pharmacy only had a generic brand of the pill and gave me that instead. i will definitely be switching back! i love the pill and it hasn't made me gain any weight. also my acne cleared up really fast and now i have none! my breasts went up a size also"	-10
211164	"i've taken plan b more times than i am willing to admit, but i have had 100% effectiveness with this pill. while i highly, highly recommend regular birth control, sometimes the use of this pill is necessary. i used it three weeks ago after having sex. the condom broke at the last second and he came inside of me. i was so nervous because my ovulation window had fallen right around the same time (like the last few days of the window) and i was seriously praying for the pill to work. i had all of the side effects from the morning-after pill all week long. i'm happy to say, though, the pill worked and i have my period now. do not freak out, i can tell you that using this pill, although it wreaks havoc on your body, is effective!"	-10
22319	"i was put on baclofen for muscle spasms caused from spinal stenosis. it works quite well for me. if i miss a dose, i can feel the difference. my doctor increased my dose to the maximum when i had more episode of my leg spasming."	-10
213669	"i bought monistat -1. so i made the mistake of not looking up reviews before i bought the product. i used it and about 10 minutes later i looked up reviews and found that it makes 90% of the women who have used it have had burning, soreness and itching 10x worse than before using the product. apparently it's not the infection it's your body reacting to the strong dosage of medicine . needless to say i went and tried to get this product out of me. it already dissolved from this like pill form to cream so it was definitely harder to get out. i'm scared i'm going to wake up like these women tomorrow with burning itchy hell ."	-10

229413	"horrible, evil pill. didn't realize it was causing me anxiety after being epc for false statements, they put me on it in the hospital and i was like sure okay. they rapidly ramped me to 60mg, the anxiety/nervousness from it was intense, crippling and basically made me botch an easy in and out hearing where my family fully supported me - they weren't even allowed in to testify to the falseness of why i was epc'd cause i shut down and said no contest to total bs. this drug is known for causing people to be violent. i can sort of see why it might do that. it's immensely powerful, and the &quot;doctors&quot; like to give out a needlessly high dose. the irony is, the doc i have now says i'm not even bipolar."	-10
153937	"hello again, i'm following up on my first review from january 27th of 2016. i've now had 4 vivitrol injections and gotta say, it's worked wonders. the first injection, as i said, caused migraines, vomiting, and stomach cramps. every injection i've recieved since has been good. no symptoms whatsoever, only positive results. i've been clean since november 17th of 2015. this shot is truly a lifesaver, my cravings are less frequent and very short lived. i reccomend this shot to anyone struggling with opioid dependency. my next injection is tomorrow and i'm sure the results will be the same as the last 3."	-10

148170	"after an episode of erythema nodesum from my last birth control pills, my doctor suggested i try a 3 month course of micronor to see how my body would react to the progesterone. well, i've gained 5lbs and had my period or spotting 27 out of the 42 days i've been taking it. my doctor wants me to continue on it to prepare for an iud, but honestly i don't want it if the breakthrough is going to be this problematic."	-10

30897	"i discovered my very first yeast infection just a few days ago and was recommended monistat 7 as it worked fine in the past for my mother. i don't know if the formula has recently changed or what, but on my first use it burned like hell. however, it did seem to be working and i was relieved for the next day. on the second night i used it, it still burned horribly. both nights i had to stand in the shower until i felt relief. this will be the last day i use this and i'm only on day 2. i'm scheduling an appointment to receive a pill medication instead! beware. this should be an absolute last resort if all other options are unavailable and quite frankly it should be recalled since it has been giving so many women so much pain. peace. :p"	-10
157612	"do not take this drug. it cleared up my acne, but it destroyed my mind. i became severely depressed. i've never had depression before. i would cry all the time. i began having severe panic attacks. it felt like i lost my mind for those 6 to 7 months. it was the darkest place i have ever been in my life. after stopping the medication the damage was done. the depression went away after about 6 months. but i continued to have anxiety issues, heart problems, and social anxiety. i took this medication 7 years ago. and it wasn't until about 2 or 3 years ago where i finally started feeling somewhat normal again. it caused anger spells and just does so much damage to your brain and you can't control your emotion"	-10

12177	would not recommend this. i was recently proscribed by my dermatologist by using it every evening. i used it once and the next day my entirw face was red and itchy. i heard that the irritated skin lasts for a few days. not only does it barely help my acne condition but its embarrassing and ridiculous to have to walk around with my face completely red.	-10
87631	unbelievable searing pain down the right side of my right leg always first thing in the morning after getting out of bed. i quickly take two aleve with a glass of milk and wait for the pain to subside which usually takes about forty five minutes. i am then fine for the rest of the day. i also do yoga exercises later in the day which helps.	-10
223601	"i was 9 weeks pregnant. wasnt ready ofcourse. went to the dr for the actual abortion pill which cost 500 but he was out of them. so he said i have another option which will cost less. i was in 2 minds but then he told me to trust him so there he prescribed cytotec. he instructed me to insert 6 in my vagina and drink 3. when i got home i was still hesistant, then i went ahead because it was getting late. i took a shower and inserted at 9:45. about an hour later i felt slight cramps which lasted around and hour an them got worse. not tooo major though so i took tramadol painkillers. slept like a baby until 3 am, clotting began. passed the fetus at 10 am an voila. im good to go. actual period now. checkup in 2 days with my dr."	-10
93026	ok i went to a new doc and told her about my anxiety. she said this med was a huge antianxiety plus a little antidepressant. i've been taking it for about two months. i've never gotten nauseous or sick but i'm 6'2 320lbs so who knows. i do agree with previous posts about being more sleep oriented but i got over that. i'm no longer anxious and get on with life better than before. i guess a big part of medication is the &quot;want&quot; to improve and this med helped me to follow through with that goal. if you want something to pick you up and show you how capable you can be give this a try. if not money lost. experience gained	-10

133182	"i have been on trisprintec for three years. i loved this birth control. i had no side effects and liked that the hormones followed my natural cycle (increasing amount for 3 weeks then a period). my periods were always right on time and only lasted 3-4 days. after one month of not using the pill, i was able to quickly get pregnant with my daughter. i don't think you can take the pill while breast feeding but as soon as i am done i will continue the pill again."	-10

33027	my doctor prescribed this birth control to help ease the side effects of endometriosis. she leaned towards this one because seasonique should mean less periods and less periods should mean less endometriosis pain. this medication was a totally failed for me. i know different people have different reactions to medications but my experience was not a positive one. i bled off an on very frequently and cramped. i had very bad headaches at times (unusual for me). i was extremely emotional and moody (also unusual for me) and stayed bloated a good majority of the time. i was on it for 4 and a half months and could not take it any more. also very pricey.	-10
132852	"was on microgestin 1/20 but was making me depressed, so doctor prescribed this. really only taking this to regulate periods and help clear up acne. took the pill for three nights and already have three huge cystic pimples on my face... i rarely get cystic pimples, usually just some whiteheads around time of period. also felt extremely nauseous and lightheaded. not continuing with this... it is different for everyone, but not worth it for me."	-10

131301	"i've been on nortrel 7/7/7 for about 6 months. i went on it to help with my endometriosis. the first couple months, the pain was actually much worse. though that settled and is somewhat better now. not totally gone though. i've gained about 10 pounds in those 6 months. i retain a lot of fluid while taking the active pills, and my breasts are continuously sore and heavy. i'm going to try something else with a lower estrogen level to try and get rid of this water weight."	-10
25303	"prescribed, use 12 on, 12 off. used with oxycodone. not effective, in addition patch doesn't adhere well, adhesive not strong enough to keep it in place w/o having to tape down patch. would not recommend this patch."	-10
158531	"this has been life changing in a positive way, i never thought i had an issue and finally at 29 i mentioned it to my doctor who first prescribed adderall i believe, i didn't like it. i mentioned it figuring i might as well give up, and then he suggested i try concerta. since that point my focus has gone up and i realize i did have an issue all these years! i don't take it sundays to give my mind a break, only take it if you need it and don't abuse it."	-10
101000	"i have been on rexulti for a little over 2 months. i started on 0.5 mg the first week and moved up to 1.0 mg the second week. i am taking it as an add-on to my lexapro 40mgs for mdd. my depression was almost immediately better, but by the second week my anxiety was horrible!! i began getting sores in my mouth from the constant movement of my tongue. it's uncontrollable, as is the eye blinking. i stay tired from my body being tense 24/7. my dr took my dosage down to 0.5 mg and increased my ativan but i'm still not doing any better. i'm fixing to stop it completely. i pray that the issues with my tongue and eyes will go away once i stop taking it."	-10

136396	"there should be a negative number rating for this product, since it literally made my issue far worse. i have rosacea and experience constant redness, sun-sensitivity, and long-lasting flushes. when initially applied, this product blanched my skin into a sort of blotchy-but-paler-than-usual state for about 12 hours....then all hell broke loose. i woke up in the night with the most intense rebound flushing imaginable. you could probably have used my face to smelt iron. i applied it once more, and then totally gave up. the discomfort was horrific, and to make matters worse, my poor skin was completely out of wack for about a week after; extra flushy, super sensitive, and generally awful. seems like most people have a similar experience."	-10
229617	"i was suicidal and depressed for months. feels like years. i'm on wellbutrin as well but have been for years with no improvement. latuda at 40 mgs has changed my life in 3 weeks. i'm not manic. i'm just normal and happy. high stress situations don't make me spiral, setbacks aren't out of proportion and damn if i'm not in awe that people live like this naturally and take it for granted."	-10

213574	"hey, yeah so....i put this in about 9pm last night before i read all y'all reviews so, kinda got spooked but, i didn't experience any burning, itching , or discomfort. the gel did melt everywhere outside my vagina which took away any itchiness from my vulva. i recommend sleeping with no panties so you can really air out, just be cautious not to stain anything. it's about 11am &amp; i can tell my yi is completely gone. i am gone to shower &amp; wipe all the melted gel off my outsides &amp; let the rest of medicine still inside me marinate throughout the day."	-10
22296	i was using a walking stick 2 weeks ago. i don't feel like my legs are made of rubber anymore and am able to walk short distances without assistance. i am excited about this medication and the future of walking again. i am still working through the need to take an afternoon nap.	-10
84828	still cannot get rid of this acne. i took this for a month and my face went from having 2 pimples to a full blown breakout. acne everywhere. ruined my skin. i heard it gets worse before it gets better but my skin was already great so this did nothing but ruin it. now i've been off it for almost a month and my face is slowly healing but these scars are everywhere :(. don't take this birth control.	-10

177455	"i wanted to write this in the hope of helping others. i've been dealing with chronic back pain that got a lot worse and intolerable the last few months. i couldn't sit, or drive without back spasms and shooting nerve pain. i was at my wits end. i tried a medrol 5 day pack, it didn't seem to help much. my doctor suggested a low dose 20mg of cymbalta. i was desperate so i thought i would try it and it's made a major difference- almost immediately. the side effects were bad for about 3-4 days, super tired, yawning non stop, very fuzzy, and no appetite. but i've been on it now for almost a month and i'm back to light workouts, and able to do mostly normal things. it does effect your libido though. my dr also recommended valium at night."	-10

50029	"introduced when i came down with the shingles, a most painful ailment which covers most of your torso. hydrocodone didn't phase it, my doctor explained how it worked and what was happening to my nerve endings. shingles changes you life because it likes to linger around and your nerve ending have changed. so i'm on 600's 3 tid, makes life more pleasant. hope this is helpful."	-10
156047	"30 with great testosterone levels but recently been having issues in the bedroom with new girlfriend. talked to doctor because i just couldn't understand it. had some anxiety after a stomach illness and just thought it may have trickled into my mind and how i have sex. in any event the doctor gave me cialis, took 10mg last night. i literally can't stop getting erections. now i'm walking around trying to walk off an erection. this stuff works! i've been flying at half staff a lot too. no side effects either, i took one 5mg pill and about 30 mins later took another 5mg pill. i'd say it's worth the shot for anyone needing to boost confidence down there."	-10

221541	had my first baby at 32 weeks and with my second baby i started the shots at 19 weeks with my dr's i am pleased to say i'm 38 weeks with pregnancy and couldn't be happier with how the shots went. they are painful but it was worth it to know in not going to deliver baby in the nicu or have to worry about how small she will be as i did with my first... i would love to tell any mother that has the option to use the shots to do so!!	-10
169299	"this medicine helped me so much to relieve some of the pressure in my head and leveled the pressure in my eyes. i also have edema of the legs and it gets so bad that at times i retain over 20 lbs of water which slows me down terribly. the pills helped me greatly and kept me active. however my doctor decided to take me off them and put me on topamax because though the pressures were down, the headaches and pain was still there. i have gained so much weight because i barely move at times and have not been as active as i once was. my legs and now my abdomen are filled with fluid. wish i could get diamox again!"	-10

12021	"i used to take nifedipine 10 mg plus metoprolol tartrate 25mg (twice daily) to reduce my blood pressure. nifedipine's effect caused fluctuation of blood pressure each day. a doctor recommend me to replace by taking 5 mg amlodipine besylate and 80 mg of diovan (valsartan) once each day. i took metoprolol for couple of years already. the recent changes reveals two things, by stop taking metoprolol, my heart beat is faster (new 68 and previously about 60) and i felt irregular heart beat. now i doubt if i should discontinue metoprolol as this medicine put my heart at ease."	-10
1265	"imitrex did not work for me. i have not reached the vomiting stage of a migraine in years thanks to other medications. imitrex did nothing to stop the progression of my migraine. i had to leave work in the middle of the afternoon, feeling as if i would vomit at my desk, in the hallway, in the elevator, walking to the parking garage, the entire way. aleve works better than this stuff, and aleve only keeps nausea at bay, but does not cure migraines for me."	-10
143483	"this is awful. i've been on this for two years. every thing was ok the first couple months but then it caused severe depression and i mean full blown suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for honestly no reason at all. no huge life changes just same old same old when the depression started. also the bleeding, my god, the bleeding is endless. i can't with 100% accuracy say it's effective because of the zero desire to even have sex, which could be because of the endless bleeding. i went from very sexually active to nothing almost immediately after having it put in. i'm having it taken out early and do not recommend this to anybody!!! there's got to be something better out there."	-10
9191	"i started this pill when i was 22. i've been taking it for 3 years now and i'm very pleased with it. i was nervous about starting birth control because of all the side effects you hear about. but i have not gained weight, i don't have mood swings. nothing negative. i had bad periods/cramps before and they are gone. i don't really get a period anymore. which i'm happy with. it's worth trying if you want a low dose birth control and you have bad periods. also there are coupons online so it's not so expensive. it was $25 a month. now it's $25 for 3 months."	-10
61144	awful medication. i was on xifaxan for a week and a half when it started giving me crippling stomach cramps every time i ate. the cramps have persisted three weeks beyond stopping the medication and i can only eat plain rice/pasta and peas. it also didn't do what it was prescribed to do and i still have symptoms of ibs. all it did was give me a side effect that makes me not able to eat.	-10
87891	"i was on iv for 4 days and then switched to oral 4x a day. when i started taking it orally i got bad heartburn, felt like something was stuck in my throats and sometimes it hurt in my chest. i questioned the pharmacist and she told me to take an anti acid 1/2 hour before my dose (one was good for 2 doses) and drink lots of water. i did this and had no more problems."	-10

87575	"wow has this changed my life. i was a long time sufferer of migraines and headaches. advil and tynelols are like candy to me now and don't do a thing to relief pain. even heavy prescribed migraine drugs by my doctor did not work as much as aleve does! it is simply, for my part, miraculous! it works 99.9% of the time. it works to prevent a headache when i feel it coming. it also works to break the headache or migraine when it is already ongoing and painful. and most of the time, a single pill works. i have to say i really hope my body doesn't come used to aleve and therefore making it less effective. so far, after a little more than a year taking aleve, it still is perfectly effective in my case. don't hesitate to try!"	-10

78887	"i have had significant leg pain for a long time. this medication took about 1-2 months to start working, but then it was great. i could run on the treadmill at much faster speeds and for much longer - when previously i'd have cramps. also, standing stationary used to be painful after 5-10 minutes - but this also improved. the only problem is that this medication can cause anxiety and insomnia since it is derived from xanthine (chemical &quot;cousin&quot; of caffeine). this is listed as a rare side effect on the drug insert, but i have heard it is more common from my doctor. i was actually given this for peyronie's disease (off-label), but it didn't do much for that. it is supposed to inhibit tgf-beta (a cytokine) - decreasing scar tissue."	-10

227448	"i got this medicine because i couldn't take the pill at the same time every day. i've had unprotected sex with my boyfriend, so in that sense it works great! for my period it's different. i stopped taking my pill because for a few weeks before i got the insert, i didn't have my period for months before but not too far behind getting the insert i finally started! but now its been 2-3 weeks and i still haven't stopped. it slowed way down and got lighter and i'd stop for a day or two but then it got heavier after that. also, my cramps are horrible now and my lower backs been in pain for about 2 weeks now. i'm not sure if these are because of the nexplanon or because of something else."	-10
121989	"one of the best medications i have taken for depression, one warning is do not run out of this medication, because you will experience terrible withdrawals, and when you re-take it the nausea is terrible. if i can stay on this medicine for a long time, i will be happy, never had better control of my depression than i do on effexor."	-10
142518	"so i had drunk unprotected sex august 13 2017 and when i woke up i started to panic and made my boyfriend leave work so we can go buy this pill. i took the pill 12 hours after sex, i took it with food and right after fell asleep. a couple days after taking the pill those side effects hit me crazy i was feeling so bad it was the worst, from horrible cramps/abdominal pains to being tired all the time to getting headaches eating a lot and getting depressed out of no where. that happened for about two weeks the third week i experienced tender breasts and i started spotting brown/red blood i was a bit relief once i saw almost all the people that took it bled to. it was a good sign so i bled for about four days and it led to my period!!"	-10
112170	this drug has saved my life. i had a bad fall and laid for 20hrs before anyone found me. i now have severe nerve damage in my legs and feet. it helps the nerve pain definitely!	-10
77673	"i've been prescribed this antibiotic many times. i just realized that with my current course for a skin infection that i sweat profusely when i take this. the last time i had episodes of profuse sweating was the last time i was on this! i don't see it listed anywhere as a side effect, but it seems to happen to me every time i take it."	-10
90622	"i honestly didn't think abreva would work. i got the first signs of a cold sore on a thursday morning and applied the abreva immediately. on friday, my cold sore blistered just a little bit and was somewhat itchy but the abreva definitely kept the cold sore from getting any bigger and under control. by saturday, i noticed that the blisters were already drying out and on the way to healing well. one sunday, it was gone completely! i'd definitely use abreba again! without it, i'd have to face a whole week or more of enduring a very itchy, fast growing and ugly cold sore that would make me feel ugly and very self-conscious."	-10
213406	"so far so good, took first dose 21 hours ago. tad foggy this afternoon, but really nothing else! vl=56k and cd4=160 @ first blood work 3 weeks ago. go back in a month and will report results. glad to have finally crossed the start line! don't fear treatment or stribild anymore, but dang the first 30 days knowing i have hiv were very tough."	-10
185206	"finished harvoni april 30, 2015. first blood work undetected hcv . second blood test august 19,2015 still undetected. next blood work december. the final blood work may, 2016. doc said after august blood work most likely cured.. was on three month treatment"	-10
119973	"prescribe losartan march 4th, 2014. atenolol 50mg before that for the past 20 years just wouldn't get my pressure below 140/85. within 1 day of starting this medication i casually commented to my wife that i felt like i had been beaten up. i couldn't for the life of me figure out why i felt so stiff and sore. the past three days i have felt like my heart is coming out of my chest. complete loss of appetite. march 7th today and i called my physician's office and told the receptionist what i was dealing with and explained i would no longer take the medication. this was my first visit to this particular doctor due to relocating. expecting a call tomorrow and hopefully go back to atenolol with a higher dosage."	-10
124885	"my insurance company just switched me from ortho-tricyclen to tri-previfem. this is my second month on it. my period usually lasted for 3 days also. this time it's been 5 days. and in the past 2 days, i've had a lot of bleeding. i've gone through over 10 pads already today. i will stop taking it and try to go back to ortho tri-cyclen. i'd been on ortho tri-cyclen for many years and never had any side-effect."	-10
152382	had a bad allergic reaction to this medication after 2 pills and stopped taking it. asked for another different medication.	-10
42408	very effective. i would feel pleasant within 15 - 20 minutes of taking one tablet of tenormin. no side effects felt.	-10
141971	lexapro has helped me so much. it's great! this is coming from a person who has tried nearly every treatment available for relief of my fibromyalgia.	-10
157074	"i began to have breakouts after the mastectomies...had to take hormonal pills. i tried so many things, went to dermotologist and tried stuff. what really worked was a skin regimen and taking a low does antibiotic (doxycycline) then my daughter told me about differin. i have been on this for almost 3 months. there has been some good clearing up, dry patches where the blemishes were. my face is very oily and so this didn't bother me. i never moisturize because of the oil..all of them make my skin break out even more. expect to have some breakouts as you get used to this. i am almost down to the wire, things are clearing up slowly but surely. medicare doesn't not cover lots of meds like this so otc"	-10
88177	"i have been taking 300 mg 2 tablets, 3 x a day for four days now for an abscess on my lower leg. i haven't experienced any major side effects but i also take it with at least a cup and a half of water and i have eaten about 4 cups of yogurt a day too. they told me that yogurt would help any yeast infection that i might get from the antibiotics. so far so good.. no heartburn, no nothing except that the swelling and redness are now gone! i still have 3 days to go, but i give this antibiotic a thumbs up!"	-10
180521	i have struggled with asthma my whole life. i used my inhaler on average 10 times a day. i started breo it started working right away. by day 3 i noticed that i hadn't used my inhaler all day. using breo has given me tremendous relief! i love it and it has seriously given me a better quality of life.	-10
37154	i developed severe shoulder pain in both shoulders after about 5 days. the doctor assured me it wasn't the vyvanse. well after 2 weeks of severe pain i thought i'd do my own google search and found plenty of people complaining about vyvanse causing joint pain. i stopped taking vyvanse as soon as i read these forums where people described their joint pain. after 3 days 80% of the pain was gone and it took about a month before 95% was gone. my left shoulder now 'clicks' and often i wake up and my left shoulder is in a position where it's very painful. i wish the doctor would go over all side effects when then prescribe medication so you know when something starts to happen that it is the medication.	-10
215716	"don't be afraid! it was extremely painful for me, emotionally and physically, but i trusted my doctor, and it made the whole procedure so much easier. i got my iud in at 10am and was in bed the rest of the day with the most excruciating cramps for about 24 hours following. i faithfully applied a heating pad and doterra's deep blue muscle relaxing cream and felt like a new person the following day! i even exercised pain free. for those of you considering getting an iud i highly recommend going to a doctor with a record of inserting iud's. avoid planned parenthood if you can, and make sure you're on your period when you get it inserted. good luck ladies! power to the vagina."	-10
213392	"this is my second time using the benzamycin gel. i would have to say that while it worked great when used properly, it did not get rid of my acne for good. it took about a month to start to see real results. the results lasted for about 1-2 months after i stopped taking the medication. sadly my acne slowly started returning. i am now waiting to see a dermatologist to start accutane."	-10
96763	"i've been dealing with eczema my entire life (27 year). i've always gotten made fun of horribly for it growing up. i've tried so many different products with none of them working, leaving my skin always flared up. eucrisa has been the only thing to ever work on my skin. i see a difference in 2 days and after only 2 weeks of using it i've noticed a huge difference in the overall feel and look of my skin! the only downside to me, which i can deal with easily, is that it feels for slimy after application for a few hours. i've been using it at night due to this. hope this helps others!!"	-10
97622	"bones hurt a lot, hot flashes were really bad."	-10
3206	"holy hell this drugs sucks! i was prescribed pills 2x a day for 3 days. my first was fine, but when i took the 2nd at night after i had eaten before bed that changed. am i the only one who feels like they have something caught in their throat? every time i drink or eat something i literally spit it up. not puking its more regurgitating. like i can't eat? i took 3rd pill thinking maybe i drank too much water and will try again. i could barely swallow pill and spit up food again! then i started having tunnel vision and feeling clammy and nervous. i am also constipated so that's awesome. i went in to doctor and i am pretty sure he thinks i am crazy and mental. i stopped taking it, but i still can't eat and i am still a bit dizzy at times."	-10
603	"i was on the shot for almost 2 years since my doctor didn't want me on the pill because i have high blood pressure due to my first pregnancy. well it backfired, i gained 30 pounds after starting the shot, became extremely depressed, mood swings, and my sex drive completely gone. also i am blonde and my leg hair turned brown. i have been on the shot for almost 4 months and have started spotting very little and acne on my back, migraines and wicked cramps."	-10
137549	i was presrcibed accutane by my dermatologist. my skin cleared up after a month of taking the medication. it worked wonders. but then my acne started to come back a few months later. i was put back on it and just finished my second round. my skin is clear and healthy. works wonders. highly recommended.	-10
41597	"great info. have taken suboxone years ago for an oxycontin &quot;vacation&quot; from reality so i knew it was just as addictive and spent a week in bed with the flu that prevented me from taking it so was horrible. just coming off over a year of overprescribed hydromorphone (dilauded) 48+ a day. started running out earlier and earlier and finally just decided, after scaring my family, was time to stop. thought i was smart and 3 days of tiny amount of suboxone and i'd be fine. not so much...over a week later had to demand they let me try this as i can't control the cns issues. i drink a lil so i'm nervous. plan to try first dose tonight and praying for sleep and just mind/body rest. md's don't like it when you think of getting off meds before they do!"	-10
31608	"took monistat 1. was fine until i had to go pee, some of the stuff leaked and oh dear father above...the itching and burning was relentless! mind you, i didn't have any itching before!! i took a shower to try and clear out whatever i could, now i'm sitting with ice packs tucked between my thighs for some relief! wondering how long before i can actually go to bed!!!"	-10
217877	"i have been on it a few months, with great results for my add. i have greater concentration and am up getting things done, instead of vegging in front of the tube. the major drawback has been sweating. i was getting chills and sweating a lot! originally thought it could be hormones, but not after reading others' comments matching my symptoms. i was jittery at first, but now smooth sailing. i tell lots of people how happy i am with the results. i loved welbutrin but am allergic."	-10
186941	"i had moderate acne and frequently got cystic acne due to my extremely oily skin. the cystic acne was so deep and painful that i asked my doctor about what to do and she perscribed me this. i swear it works miracles! my acne was virtually gone after 2 weeks, and my ultra oily skin felt normal and smooth! even though the box says it only helps acne vulgaris, benzaclin really works on cystic acne as well."	-10
67114	"i have acid reflux and i love food, sometimes or most of the time i eat too much of the wrong foods and pay for it. phillips mom relieves the pressure and is a blessing when i'm stuffed up and no bowel movement occurs so there's only discomfort. i also sleep so much better after going a cpl times, thank god for this magical medicine."	-10
157726	"accutane has been a miracle drug for me. i have not had a single pimple since the 2nd month of treatment, and i've been off it for just under a month. my acne, like others, was horrible before accutane. another thing to note, i had virtually zero side-effects, just a little bit of dryness around my mouth and lips. it was nothing like the horror stories you read about on the web. just brush your lips with a toothbrush in the morning and at night and put some aquaphor/lip balm on after and you'll be fine for the whole day. i also always ate tons of healthy fats (grass-fed butter and meat, eggs, organic full-fat dairy, coconut butter, avocados, olive oil, macadamia nuts, and natural peanut butter) with my accutane, so that may have helped too."	-10
10581	"i have been on this medication for 9 years straight. i was prescribed it when i was 18 and had been having awful cramps and nausea during my period, as well as it being irregular. since i started this birth control i have only had minimal cramping and have never been sick from my period again. i did not feel any different when i started it and i have never experienced a negative side effect. i have nothing bad to say about this medication; all i have gotten from it is regulated, shorter and lighter periods, pregnancy prevention and bigger boobs. all great things in my opinion"	-10
186474	i started on pristiq 1 1/2 years ago for depression. i was on 50 mg and it was great until about 3 months ago. i am going to see if my dosage can be increased.	-10
64721	"growing up i always exhibited symptoms of ocd, however, my mother didn't believe that medication was the best route at a young age. i respected her decision throughout adolescence and tried to cope with my ocd on my own, using different vitamins such as b complex, etc. i met the love of my life last year and everything was wonderful until my relationship ocd kicked in with a vengeance. it almost ruined my relationship and my life, but i decided to seek professional help. my psychiatrist started me on zoloft in june and i cannot express how much my life has changed because of it. i am a kinder person, and i can focus on the people and things i love, instead of constantly worrying about my health, relationship, etc. i highly recommend it!"	-10

185898	"this drug made my executive functioning a lot better, but it also almost immediately made me super down and caused partial seizures (i have no history of epilepsy). it may have triggered an episode of psychosis as well but i am still uncertain whether it was a psychotic episode or a seizure as i also lost control and sensation in my limbs while hallucinating before losing consciousness completely. i would not recommend this drug."	-10
158759	"for me, who is about to be 40 years old, i found that i had a shorter fuse than normal, couldn't finish anything, no energy, no focus. went in to talk with a doctor and he tested me and found that i too was adhd. i cannot tell you that i was shocked. he said it was bad enough to warrant 36mg starting point. i started it on a thursday and by sunday i had lost 6 lbs already. not that i didn't like losing that much but not the way it happened. i have been so nauseated. now, days are not too bad but i feel like i am crashing at night and also very nauseated at night still. i cannot take this anymore. i will actually go back to the way i was, before i will keep up with this. for my son at 81mg a day. it is absolutely fantastic for him."	-10
230523	i got on this as a teenager for my endometriosis. besides spotting for the first four months i have had no ill effects. no weight gain. in fact its hard to keep weight on. i got off of it to have my kids. now i'm back on it. it's so much easier raising toddlers without cramps and random bleeding. i recommend it highly. don't let bad experiences scare you. i actually had a horrible time with the pill. i love my depo shots!	-10
52595	i and 3 other family members that have low thyroid and all have found this works best. however at this time we are unable to get any and have been put on synthroid.	-10

160217	i've been taking xarelto for 1 month now for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. i haven't experienced many side effects. it seems to be working great except my period is extremely heavy and i'm taking an iron supplement.	-10
32170	"debated long and hard, but finally asked my obgyn for wellbutrin xl for hormonal mood issues. i work for a psychiatrist so i'm well informed of my options and felt this medication was my first choice for symptoms and fewest chances of unwanted sexual and weight gain side effects. 2 weeks into treatment at 150mg. feeling an overall clear and light heartedness. this week should be the height of my pms and i am not cranky! also helping a lot with decreasing appetite and smoking is very unappealing. very minor stomach unsettle, and i've been waking more in the middle of the night, but side effects generally mild and tolerable. may ask to increase dose to 300mg. i wish i had asked for this medication sooner!"	-10
26364	"terrible pill. depressed, lethargic, moody, snappy, no appetitie but weight gain some how, constipation, white bumps on skin....nothing positive to report except that a little less dry than usual. not worth it though"	-10
49267	throwing mine in the trash!! i've been on aubra for about three weeks. been spotting/bleeding ever since. i have had the worst headache of my life for two weeks straight not to mention the nausea and vomitting. i'd rather just risk a pregnancy. this is ridiculous. i can't even function with daily life.	-10
23959	amazing. i am experiencing only mild peeling and the benefits are phenomenal. skin is virtually poreless and very smooth. pores are clean. speeding up healing of acne marks. love it.	-10
97889	worse birth control ever. it is good at preventing pregnancy for three years but the bleeding never stops you bleed from the time you had it up until the day you get it removed i know the point is to prevent pregnancy but come on now no one wants to bleed every day and it is an embarrassing thing to go through dating and while you're in a relationship	-10
40955	"percocet is great for relieving my chronic pain. i have endometriosis, and have tried so many pain relievers- naproxen, tramadol, norco, and ms contin to name a few. oxyxodone has worked best for me because the onset is fast and it is a little stronger than norco and tramadol. the only downside is i only get about 3 hrs of pain relief from one dose, but its a life saver when your in horrible pain."	-10
160372	"like you, i came to this website in a desperate attempt to find any medication thst would help alleviate the mental and physical pain that i was experiencing. i have tried a couple of different ssri medications in the past at different times but eventually discontinued them after a couple of months due to their limited effectiveness in reducing my anxiety and the side effects they caused (headache, sense of detachment, inability to gain erection or orgasm, nausea). buspirone has been very helpful at reducing my anxiety and improving my quality of life. i am currently in week 5 of my treatment of 22.5mg per day. i take 7.5mg at 8:00, 12:30, and 5:00. only side effect that i experience is dizziness 15 minutes after taking."	-10
107664	"i have been on implanon for most of my 20s. i'm currently on my 3rd dose. you would think your body would get used to the hormone by the 3rd dose but my periods have been different every time! 1st time: light bleeding, then none for rest of time, 2nd time: light irregular bleeding, then more frequent and prolonged at 2 and a half years, 3rd time: light - normal irregular bleeding. just had period 4 a week, stopped a few days, light bleeding for a few more days, then stopped again. a side effect which i experience quite often, is sore breasts. sometimes i have mood swings but i'm unsure if it's a side effect of the implanon or due to the fact that i've had depression in the past."	-10
170291	"i cannot rate seroquel highly enough. i was a mess with constant anxiety that just would not stop. i had tried so many things and seroquel literally changed my life. i take 400 xr and don't really have any side effects, but even if i did i would put up with anything to be rid of the anxiety. i don't know how i managed to get through life before i started taking seroquel"	-10
80289	"for celiac disease: greatest thing since the automobile! i can get relief now. i've had diarrhea for the past 2 weeks. slippery elm has permitted me to have regular bowel motions. no discomfort in the colon. i feel great! going to doc next week to get a complete physical, but in the meantime, i'm so grateful for this herb. i've taken it before but just forgot just how great it was. i had forgotten what &quot;normal&quot; feels like. great!"	-10

207680	"the suggestion to chill the suprep in fridge, chill your water, soda and or gatorade is great advice. yes use a straw. i put a lifesavor peppermint in my mouth to prepare for the suprep's nasty taste, then i added cold water and ginger ale to the fill line in the cup provided. using a straw, holding my nose, i quickly drank the supra with the peppermint lifesaver between my gums and cheek so in between each sip i was able to get the nasty taste out of my mouth with the mint. having a lifesaver peppermint really helps with the aftertaste! it's my 3rd colonoscopy and this time i was actually able to get through it without gagging on the stuff. yes it is like metallic grape drink!"	-10
10456	"after turning 30, i started getting severe red painful cysts along my jawline, cheeks, and forehead. they would last forever, and would not go down with any topical treatments. i had my androgen levels checked and they were 3x the normal limit. around this time, i was also having trouble maintaining my weight (5'4&quot; around 120lb), my skin became really oily, and i felt fatigued all the time. i'm very active and eat very healthy so something was going on. i started spironolactone 25mg - 2 tablets twice daily (three times daily around the time of my cycle), and it's as if i am a new person. the initial breakouts took about 3 months to completely go away, but now i have energy, no weight issues and no acne!"	-10
743	"the first three months went alright- i was quite moody and emotional, but nothing more than how i am when i get pms. it was bearable and didn't last too long. i had one period for two weeks. after taking the second shot, i have had a period for over a month and a half now (an actual heavy period, not spotting). my acne has gotten worse. i'm definitely switching to the pill when i am ready to get my next shot."	-10
35412	"i am a 27 year old woman and was prescribed levaquin 500mg for 7 days (by my obgyn for a suspected uti post surgery-i had a d and c). i hardly ever have utis. my levaquin, with insurance, was $55. i do not take pharmaceutical drugs regularly, but i figured since this was post surgery i should do as the doctor says. i read the drug pamphlet before taking the pill. on day 3 of taking levaquin, i started a muscle twitching in my right middle toe. i researched reviews of this drug on the internet and stopped immediately."	-10
66307	"i contracted herpes 3 years ago at age 38 and was absolutely devastated after having a fun and fancy free sex life my whole adult life. i felt like my life was over. i took a natural antiviral which helped block outbreaks from eating foods high in arginine . but as my job got very stressful, the natural antiviral couldn't block that, and i was getting a breakout every few weeks. i suddenly felt like i had no control. and i was fine until i'd get an outbreak, and then it was an ugly reminder of the person who gave it to me. i went to my doctor and got 500mg per day and it really was a lifesaver! it's great for suppression and i recommend. it gives self esteem back!"	-10
138930	"i started using adipex on 11/7/09. i weighed in at 161lbs. i am going in to the 3rd week and have had an average weight loss of 4 lbs a week. i love this medication. i have always worked out and watched what i ate, but still had problems losing weight. it seems now in the 3rd week that i am not as energetic and the weight is coming off slower. i did have problems sleeping the first few days and dry mouth very bad. the worst side effect for me is acne... i have never had pimples on my face and since i have taken this drug, they are popping up everywhere. i think i will stop when this months supply is gone. i am hoping to lose 20 more lbs, but i don't expect it to all happen right now. i am very satisfied! i haven't been this happy in years!"	-10
94890	"it has helped me to get out of the worst depressive episode of my life (1.5 years), but i only sleep a few hours a night, my arms and shoulders feel like lead weights, and i tend to have racing thoughts. i am still trying to figure out whether to stay on it or not."	-10
151159	i have suffered with an incurable rare spinal cord injury. i first tried oxycontin in december 2010. little did i know that they were taking the generics off the shelves. the medicine worked great.the new oxy op is very expensive and not of the same release time. how are people going to afford this?	-10
122821	"i was prescribed cryselle for extremely heavy periods due to a fibroid tumor. the bleeding i experienced not only interfered with my daily life, but also caused anemia and seemed to only be getting heavier by the month. i started taking cryselle 4 months ago - and haven't experienced any negative side effects (other than the expected break through bleeding month two, which i attributed to my body adjusting to the medication). my periods are much lighter! also,pms type symptoms like sore breasts and bloating have significantly decreased. i'm very pleased so far with cryselle!"	-10
82357	"i started victoza about 5 weeks ago. now i have seen about 20 lbs come off and moved the belt notch from the middle notch to the last position (and will need a new belt soon). nausea has only happened about 3-4 times and was mild to moderate. blood glucose level has settled from 170 to 130 over the last 2 weeks. eating behaviors have changed dramatically. most meals are 4-5 bites and i push the plate away being fully satisfied. it has been quite a shock learning how to eat more wisely and that i can &quot;push the plate away&quot; instead of feeling compelled to finish everything on the plate (yes, i raised 4 kids). i am hoping to lose about another 35-40 lbs."	-10
34780	"i've been taking 100mg 2 times a day for 3 months now. it has cleared my shoulders/back/chest pretty well as well as my face being mostly clear too. it works best if you take it consistently. i am a very busy 16 year old girl with sports and school. if i skip a dosage i notice a few blemishes on my shoulders appear. if you get on this and you don't see a difference in a month, call your doctor and ask if they can up your dosage. if you follow the regulations and take it as directed, it works pretty good. i recommend it to anyone who is struggling with finding a face wash to work for them."	-10
204612	"this medication is great, it gave me no side effects at all. although it takes time to reach its full therapeutic effect its worth the wait. this medication helps me calm down reduces agitation, anxiety, and panic. for me it has been better than the other faster acting drugs for agitation, anxiety, panic that i've tried in the past."	-10
28481	"hello to everyone reading this. in the summer of 2012 i had the worst panic attack. i thought i was having a heart attack and immediately rushed to the hospital. long story short, i was prescribed lexapro since i was not progressing and had lost 40 lbs in less than a month. i spent nights crying asking why me. within two weeks of taking 20mgs, i felt like my old self again. i was no longer socially anxious when it came to conversing with people and was thankful to be alive. the depressed and anxious me stayed home all day and lay in bed, but not anymore. been off it 3 months now but advice to others is not to research 100 different sites for side effects."	-10
131116	"i have had my iud for over a year now and i think it's the best thing ever. when i first got it put in i only bled for about a week with a little cramping. after that nothing at all. i haven't had a period for about 8months until i finally got one, and its not bad at all. it's light, no cramping, no headache, nothing. i haven't gained weight, my acne is gone, and my moods are fine. i know all women are different, but i just hear all these horror stories and i just wanted to tell my story, which is a good one. hope it calms some of your fears."	-10
175011	"i was constantly getting sick or an infection from it, leading to increased number of relapses. it gave me cystic acne from my bellybutton to my knees, a lot of nausea, and i suspect it affected my lung function, but they quit testing that side effect. i also mentally did not feel like myself somehow. i felt so much better and like myself again after coming off of it."	-10
78259	"i took my 40 mg today have peed 5 times this past 2 hours, other than that so far i feel fine. this is a first for me to ever take a water pill, but so far it seems to do its job."	-10
173296	i'm bipolar and suffer from panic attacks. i'm really impressed with how well clonazepam works. i take 0.5mg x 4 times daily. i do feel a sense of calm and evenness with this medication which is important with my bipolar disorder. highly recommended.	-10
24281	"i am a 15 year old female experiencing acne from puberty. i was prescribed the medication by my dermatologist. i am also using acanya un the morning with neutrogena spf. in addition, i am moisturizing with cetaphil. at first i noticed the treatment was working well besides mild stinging and redness, but after three weeks i am now having an increase in white heads in areas i have never had any problems with like my cheeks and chin. the acne seems to be small fine bumps that are deep under my skin - i believe theses are called closed comodones. hopefully this is just the initial breakout."	-10
6747	"i was on beyaz for one month and had to switch. it made me tired and nauseous. it gave me the worst headaches. they would last all day and advil did not take the pain away. maybe if i waited the whole 3 months, it would've straightened out but i just couldn't deal with the awful headaches. but like everyone says, everyone's body is different. only pro: my mild acne seemed to clear up."	-10
34203	"i have had fibromyalia for years and have been prescribed many different pain medicines. i have also been seeking less pharmaceutical ways of dealing with my pain. one doctor prescribed tryptophan to me and i thought it was great and have had to use less pain medicines because of it, however i did not know that it was classified as an ssri so when my new doctor prescribed tramadol to me and bumped me right up to the highest dose and i took it with my tryptophan i got really really sick. it took me a few days to figure out what was going on but i was having a major drug interaction called serotonin syndrome. be careful. yes, this drug works wonders on pain but can be dangerous with many other drugs."	-10
19679	"i usually have bad migraines that knock me out for a day or two every week. today i had the aura, the nausea and all my senses started feeling fuzzy like they do when it's coming on. this time, the troubles went away in an hour and i was left with a minimal headache. this is on lyrica 2x75mg daily, that i actually take for social anxiety disorder/generalized anxiety disorder."	-10

168430	"burn, burn, burn!!!! do not take this product without consulting your doctor first. made everything worse, first night i had to sleep with an ice pack on my bottom. second night was all i could take stomach pain, burning, itching all over my bottom. ended up washing it all out, icing again and took two benadryl."	-10
32279	"they changed the pill. i've been taking the original version for many years with no problem. finished my original ones and started on the newer version pills. on sat, sept 23rd, rushed to hospital with 201/103 blood pressure. something is wrong with this new pill. i hope that no one dies, or has a heart attack or stroke. i am calling the fda today."	-10
156778	"i got this shot during a doctor visit. unsure if dose was the .75 mg but the 3 samples he gave me were of the 1.5 mg dose. side effects began following day: nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, indigestion and severe acid reflux. i also had body aches and fatigue. i dare say i felt depressed. i had just gotten over the stomach flu 3 weeks before and it felt like i had come down with it again! trulicity did lower my glucose levels as did my weight (3 lbs. that week) of course it did! i could not eat and what ever little food i ate, it came out in minutes! i did not and will not inject myself with this again i'm sorry i agreed on the shot. one of the worst weeks of my life!"	-10

180895	"i have terrible anxiety and was very afraid to take biaxin because i'd never taken it before. i worry about crazy things like having an anaphylactic reaction to medications, throat swelling shut, not being able to breathe, hives ect. i was on a triple antibiotic treatment of biaxin, flagyl, and prilosec twice a day with protonix taken alone every morning. i always ate yogurt twice a day with the medication as well as a meal so i my stomach wouldn't hurt or be upset. i never took the medication without food as instructed so i never had any stomach problems at all. the only side effect i had was an odd taste in my mouth but it wasn't overwhelming or bothersome."	-10
63987	"continuation from alee: i went to the er and my potassium was low; now i'm on potassium pills for 3 days. today 6/16/17 i had my first panic attack in over a few weeks, my heart was pounding really hard and fast; my left side was numb, i couldn't breathe; so i showered and it calmed me down a bit. i'm hesitant to start back on the zoloft...any suggestions?"	-10
117188	i had orthoscopic surgery on both knees for meniscal turns from over use during my time in the military. after choosing the injections verses cortisones or steroid shots i've had excellent results. i'm 45 and still run 4 miles every other day without any pain. the injections were not painful and took only minutes in the doctors office. i finished two series and now ready for my third. i give it and excellent rating.	-10
461	"i am 18 and have been on depo since i was 15 due to severe menstrual bleeding. when i first got the shot i noticed my bleeding kept lightening up until my second shot and it stopped all together. i eat like a pig, but that's not really a big deal for me. during the first 4-5 months i lost 40 pounds, and slightly over a year later i've gained 20 back. i know a lot of girls fidget and carry on over the weight issue, but if you exercise daily and eat appropriately, it won't turn into a big deal. i definitely recommend this to my friends who either have bleeding issues or just don't want to get pregnant. works perfectly in both cases; at least for me!"	-10
38874	"i have had gerd for almost one year, and this med is the only one that seems to be working for me, as always its not 100% effective since i still have night symptoms sometimes, but its way better than any other med out there ( i've tried out omeprazol and lansoprazole, and no one of them were efficient for me). on the other hand, i didn't notice any important side effects, the only one mentionable is some queasiness when i'm in the bus/car and i'm not watching the road ( i'm looking to the phone), which is something i've experienced very rarely before starting the esomeprazole treatment."	-10
194024	"i pretty much have my period all month with exception of maybe 3 days. i am going to stop taking this, even though it's nice to have unprotected sex."	-10
113208	"i have been battling constipation for a week now and had finally given in and bought dulcolax laxative tablets (worst mistake ever). i took one tablet a 9 pm, woke up in a cold sweat at 2 am and experienced stomach cramps (with the urge to go but couldn't) and horrendous vomiting. finally settled back in to bed around 3:30 am i am now up again 8am back in the bathroom with the worst case of diarrhea and stomach cramps. product is somewhat effective but plan to take it on a friday night with no other weekend plans!"	-10
76851	i have been on the medication for a month now and today i go dr. to see my weight loss.i sometimes forget i have not eaten so i make myself eat and drink plenty of water sometimes i'm eating 1 time per day. also i noticed because i love fried chicken i would only eat it once a week but i can no longer eat the chicken - it makes me sick. this pill has helped me in so many ways. i'm thankful to god and the doctor. i need to loose this weight for health issue and i'm going to be a grandma so i need to be here. i will let you all know how much i lost.	-10
40082	"started taking contrave today to help me lose about 20-30 pounds. well so far it's not working it hasn't suppressed my appetite, but i will finish out the bottle and see if i lose anything."	-10
10844	i have been taking these pills for abnormal cycles. i've had an ultrasound and a biopsy and doctors couldn't find anything. have to take 3 pills a day just to slow up bleeding. has anyone else had this problem if so did they finally get some relief.	-10
75554	"i'm 15 and have been getting bad migraines for about a year. i have been taking inderal for a few weeks. i have felt car sick for almost the entire time i've been on this medication, i have been really emotional, and have not had an appetite, and been very dizzy and am still getting headaches."	-10
70513	"i was suffering for many weeks with pain , extreme urge to urinate at getting up 10-15 times a night . urine volume was low plus very weak stream . my doctor subscribed flomax . took the first one four hours before bedtime . almost cried because all the symptoms disappeared . finally a good nights sleep . couldn't believe how fast it worked . after a couple of days was back to my normal self . normal stream , no pain or urge to urinate . though it was a miracle drug . then , after three days , the side affects started showing up . first a slightly sore back . then overall general muscle weakness , dry ejaculation ( reverse ) , soft erection , very weak orgasm at first and finally no orgasm period . stopped using this today . day 5 ."	-10
197819	"my bp is sometimes still a bit high. i have some eye strain, but the worst thing is the strange, vivid dreams that occur nightly. i used to take a different beta blocker, but the insurance company won't cover it."	-10
49073	"i've recently switched from trinessa (taken for 18 years) to amethia (taken for 6 months). i discontinued amethia mostly due to mood change &amp; weight gain. pros: effective in preventing pregnancy, normal periods lasted 4-5 days once every 3 months. cons: severe moodiness and impatience in first 1 1/2 months which turned to moderate depression for remaining months and overall general unhappiness. increased appetite which led to increase weight gain in the belly (5-7 lbs in 6 months). extreme bloating in belly area in the 2nd &amp; 3rd month in each cycle. mild monthly cramping during times when period normally comes. bone &amp; muscle pain - mostly in knees &amp; legs &amp; teeth. cost of medication was high (based on my insurance coverage)"	-10
101887	"i lost my fingernails suddenly about a year ago. i spent over half a year trying at home remedies but nothing worked. i've been taking this medication for about 5 months now and i will tell you this - it doesn't work fast but if you stick with it the nausea and side effects will eventually die down and you will eventually start growing new nail. my two worst nails (my thumbs) are still oddly shaped, but when i look back at the photo i took the first day i realized that the nails were separating from my bail bed, i can see that i've gained back quite a bit after about 5 months. i'm not sure i will ever have my beautiful nails back, but this medication has given me hope that some day (maybe years from now) i will be back to normal."	-10
230814	"soon after starting micardis i suffered from dizziness, nausea, irritability and i had no energy. it continued, then i started shortness of breath. was told by my doctor it was not the medication. i went to a cardiologist and she kept me on it and put me on imdur. then severe headaches occurred. i'm now going natural and taking my chances."	-10
92085	"i have been on lyrica for a week now, 150 mg only at night and have not felt this good in three years. i am move active. i have not gain any weight yet, but hopefully be as active as i am now i will lose weight."	-10
137437	"i started accutane about 5 months ago. i've noticed a lot of these people saying that it made their acne worst in the beginning and they're hoping for better results toward the end. in the beginning, my acne actually got pretty bad, so along with the constant dryness it dropped my self-esteem pretty low. then throughout the next few weeks into the third month my acne suddenly started disappearing, and now into my 5th or 6th month i have absolutely no acne, besides the occasional zit. although i did obtain some sort of rash the doctor said was from the accutane, we originally thought it was ringworm but its a type of eczema. the doctor said it will go away in a few days with the prescribed cream."	-10
47063	"this is my second day of taking armour. i may have to get used to it. i haven't slept well since i have taken it. i feel very alert and not relaxed. i am going to stick with it since it is more of a balance of t3 and t4, i hope. i was getting no results from levothyroxine."	-10
162806	"terrible, terrible antibiotic. i took z pack for my sinus infection, which usually helps but didn't this time so my doc put me on cefdinir. no problems until the 3rd day i woke up with the most terrible diarrhea i've ever had. same the following day. it's almost 3 weeks later and i still have the diarrhea and have gone to the er once for iv fluids to help with my dehydration. i would not recommend."	-10
3049	"i took this drug after being prescribed it for a uti. i read some reviews after feeling a little weird but figured i would push through. i called my doctor after taking two pills and the nurse told me to wait it out and see if it gets worse. things got worse very quick. what began as a little bit of nausea, ended with body aches, leg cramps, intense chills, night sweats, dizziness, confusion, to fainting twice (terrifying), to getting a vaginal infection because of this drug. my uti symptoms have gotten better, but the pain from my vi is unbearable, and how i feel from this drug is terrible. not worth it...do not take this drug. p.s. i only got through taking four pills, out of my prescribed ten. i am going to the doctor today, again.:("	-10
42490	"i am currently a junior in high school on concerta going onto 4 years with it and i can honestly say it does work very well. it helps me focus a lot and you can see the results inflicted on my academics and how good they got. but the side effects are the down fall of course. i get insomnia and i lose my appetite completely for a whole day. and on top of that i feel emotionless, like a robot that all it wants to do is study and focus. it takes a toll on social life, but i guess that's the price we all have to go through when taking medications."	-10
110137	"i got nexplanon put it last july and i hate the irregular cycles and the decreased libido. my cycle came in late july last year thru late august, nothing in september or october, late november thru late december, nothing in january, all of february, nothing in march, and so far, nothing in april. it does make u nervous because it makes u wonder if you're pregnant. also, i've gotten back acne a bit. it beats the pill for me, though, because the last pills i liked were great. i had to stop taking them because they stopped making them. the very last ones i was on, which were supposed to be new ones made by the same company, sucked. they decreased my libido, made me feel sick a lot and pills are just annoying to have to take anyway."	-10
128300	"i started adipex-p on october 17th 2015... my start weight was 189... i had gained 16 lbs prior to that due to another medication i was on... my doctor recommended trying this because i was completely devastated! i've never weighed that much and had always maintained my weight even after having my 2 children... however the same time i started adipex-p i started doing herbalife shakes (breakfast and lunch) and then ate dinner with my family.. i also got somewhat of a work out in daily due to working at planet fitness and can easily walk 10,000 steps daily due to my job description... in 1 month i lost 22 lbs! :-)"	-10
70262	"the best little white angel pill ever, i have been feeling ill for seven days until today i decided to get help and went to a little clinic and got prescribed zofran, it must be made in heaven because that little pill worked in minutes, i went from 20% to 70% real quick. i work at a job that doesn't allow you to call in, so this pill will be saving me from losing 8 hours on my pay check. stomach bug sucks and was tired of feeling hungry/sick every ten minutes. thank you my white angel."	-10
80247	"i am an asymptomatic hiv white 44 years-old male with an undetectable viral load count. after ten days of severe coughing i was prescribed tessalon perles (100 mg three times a day). it works like a miracle. i am able to sleep and function well while recovering from a respiratory infection which spread to my chest. since my diagnosis almost 20 years ago, i have kept a journal of all medications which i have used. i am very happy to say that tessalon perles will be a medication listed favorably. if i ever have another infection involving a cough, i will request a prescription for this medication."	-10
162775	"let's talk about my sickness first. i was dipping my self into a freezing water pool for approximately 5 minutes a day. the next morning i felt the weather is so much colder so i knew its a fever. i'm very healthy person my body i make sure that my body is clean, i drink a lot of water and cleaning drinks so my stomach is always clean. the doctor prescriped me fevadol and omnicef. omnicef experience were horrible. very bad diarrhea every 15 minutes or so even if there is nothing in my body. i couldn't sleep for more than 24 hours with complete alertness and no feeling of exhaustion. eating it without food will make it worse. i used it for 2 days only. dosage was 1 300mg twice a day. i got dizziness, back pain, headache and diarrhea."	-10
85137	"i have been on this pill for the past 5 years now. when i first began this pill i had no issues, it immediately regulated my period and decreased cramping and acne. however, over the past few years i have noticed an increase in negative side effects associated with this pill. i find myself to become randomly depressed, emotional and angry. i have little to no sex drive as well as terrible migraines during the week before my period. i have been prescribed 800mg ibuprofen for these migraines, as my gynecologist suggested it could be due to low estrogen levels and they don't even help. i am considering changing pills due to the uncomfortable side effects."	-10
56356	"i've not been on humira for long, for about 4 months, but for me it has not helped with anything. sure, i might get a little less pain every now and then, but i still feel like i'm being torn apart from the inside out after i eat or when i try to sleep. i'm experiencing many side effects which aren't pleasant. a rare one which i have is being on my period for 2 months, coming off it for a week or two then it coming back on! i still get stomach pain, nausea, joint pain, soreness under my ribs, dry mouth and trouble swallowing, feeling lightheaded, night sweats, trouble sleeping and much more that my consultant decided to look right passed and keep me on this damn thing! i had higher hopes for this, i'm quite disappointed to say the least."	-10
173428	"ever since i was young i have used this nasal spray every time i came down with a cold. i've even tried to buy cheaper brands, but this is the only one that really works. the only downfall to the product is that it doesn't last a full 12 hours, maybe only five or six. also, i would only recommend it to those who have a cold, not for long-term use or people with allergies."	-10
104828	"i was put on this pill to hold endometriosis at bay. 7 weeks into taking the pill i got my period. it has been 9 days so far at the regular flow of my period. on my old pills, i was lucky enough to only get a period every 2 or 3 months. i am going to switch. at least on my old pills i know when i was getting my period."	-10

125281	"oh my! never again. i took two at 8:00 p.m. and at 4:00 am i woke up to the worst stomach cramping. i had diarrhrea from early morning and throughout the day into the next. the stomach cramps would come and go and with intensity. here it is tuesday, and i'm still getting waves of nausea and cramps. the worst part is the back spasms. it feels like i'm being stabbed in the middle of my back every other hour. then my stomach burbles, aches and my bowels cramp and then it stops. i would rather be constipated. i have drank bottles and bottles of water to get this garbage laxative out of my system. if you are constipated, do not take this product you will suffer in er-worthy pain"	-10
24551	"i'm 24 and had to take the prep for a colonoscopy. i was able to fairly easy get the first half down with no problem- but really struggled with the second half of the bottle. by the second bottle i was only able to get a few sips down before i threw it up (not a very pleasurable experience). i didn't have any stomach cramping and the prep worked well in clearing out my bowles. as someone else mentioned i did have some chills after taking the prep. luckily, i was still able to have the procedure done even after only drinking half the recommended dosage. not a fun experience but it was overall effective! good luck!"	-10
126969	i have pregnancies characterized by extremely severe hyperemesis gravidarum. i spend most of my pregnancy nil by mouth in the hospital and then get a picc line. they gave me reglan and let me tell you. it made me severely depressed and suicidal. it did not touch my nvp either. the combination of a very adverse reaction to this medicine and malnutrition caused me to terminate my wanted and planned pregnancy. i have dealt with severe hg before and have a 2yo. i did not realize this medicine caused this until recently i was given it before a surgical procedure. it made me out of my mind! i felt like jumping out of my skin. i tried to rip out my iv and leave the hospital! they said it's a common reaction to reglan! why wasn't i warned?!	-10
169041	"i've been on quite a few medicines the last 14 years. zoloft, prozac, paxil, wellbutrin, lexapro, xanax combination, effexor to name a few. my doctor started me on viibryd a week ago i'm on 10mg and tomorrow i start the 20mg. so far this pill has been a lifesaver. i haven't had any side effects that many people speak of. i heard you got to eat with it and the key is protein because it helps the pill absorb into your system. i've been very happy and positive but not too happy as some pills will do. so far it has been the best depression pill i have tried."	-10
182702	"i must say that it helped with my neuropathy, but from day one, i had a terrible time urinating and was experiencing horrible nightmares. as soon as i discontinued it, these symptoms went away. i am on zoloft now without any problems."	-10

15396	"i'm currently on the first week of my second month but i am stopping. the third week of my first pack, i ended up throwing up and i have been nauseous non stop since starting this pill. it also made me extremely anxious and depressed and exacerbated my pre-existing sleep problems. definitely calling the dr on monday to switch"	-10
168611	"started taking it over the summer on a starter pack. i hate eating, and if you don't eat with this med, you're going downhill. nausea, vomiting, major headaches, and more black and white bpd symptoms than without. was placed on deplin with it, but felt sick all the time. haven't been back since school started due to other things, and in all honesty, the meds made it hard. everything was elevated. nightmares were worse. little day to day events, terrible. a simple manic episode that i was used to? 12 times higher. really disliked it."	-10
107980	"i've been on the patch for 13 years. it's been amazing. no real side effects except for slight mood change before my period is due. my periods are shorter, lighter and i always know when it's coming. no weight gain. my skin is flawless. it's rare i get a pimple and if i do it clears up quickly with no marks. i love this form of birth control and would highly recommend it."	-10

32114	"i started taking wellbutrin xl 150mg once a day for the first two weeks, back in november. at first i noticed a slight change in my mood. the dr. bumped me up to 300mg once a day. i have gotten a lot better now, not depressed, angry, sad all the time. also before i started taking this i was having awful anxiety attacks to the point where i`d black out and wake up vomiting, i was losing a ton of weight because i was so depressed i had no appetite. although i haven`t experienced weight gain with this medication i still don`t have much of an appetite but i have gone back to my normal weight. drinking while taking this makes the alcohol affect you a lot quicker than usual, also causes me to black out 98% of the time."	-10

158130	i am a 48 year-old woman with bi-polar i disorder. a year ago last fall i was severely depressed. in the hospital they put me on 20 mg. geodon for depression and 10 mg. trazedone for sleep. i was already on 1000 mg tegretol. at first this combo was a lifesaver and i felt the best i have felt in years - even became slightly hypomanic and over-the-moon happy. then 4 months in my mood swung to a deep suicidal depression so i went back in the hospital for 2 weeks and they upped the geodon to 40 mg then 80 mg and the anxiety and insomnia became so bad they gave me the max they could with sleep meds and i left the hospital worse than ever. anxiety so bad i had to take clonazepam to counteract. would not take again.	-10

91304	"this medicine gave me the most horrifying, terrifying, side effects ever! i took it last summer and man the feeling is haunting! i was on a beach vacation and i took the medicine b4 heading back out to the pool, not knowing about the scary side effects. in 30 min, i became unusually sleepy and went back to the room and man i couldn't sleep! my legs were so restless it wasn't funny! i felt like i had to explode outta my damn body! my mum massaged me till i fell asleep. terrible medicine"	-10
179970	"let me just say that i've tried everything. nothing was working. some products would keep my acne at bay, but never actually get rid of it. since 7th grade, i've had severe cystic acne, along with huge whiteheads, blackheads, and tiny clogged pores that would not go away even when my skin was clear. my dermatologist prescribed epiduo along with acanya (just for the cystic acne) and cetaphil (facewash) . although i believed it would never work, after 3 months on it, my skin was clear! not just better, but actually clear! friends, family, and even strangers would compliment me on my skin. i can't believe it and it's made me amazingly confident to think that i'm one of the lucky people with clear skin. i highly recommend this."	-10
4398	"the whole point of belviq is that it is supposed to suppress one's appetite. of course to really lose more weight everything you wrote factors in. you missed the point with many reviewers.....belviq is not suppressing their appetite, like &quot;oh, i have to make myself eat&quot;, etc. that said, i have been on belviq for 3 days. i take 10mg x 2 a day. i have not noticed a decrease in appetite at all. i'm still hungry in the am and pm. bummer. no side effects either. i started at 177 lbs and just wishing my appetite would relax where i could say &quot;oh, i have to make myself eat&quot;. also, i printed up the coupon from belviq.com and paid $85.00 instead of $257.00."	-10
131722	"i have been on many anti-depressants over the years. i have had depression and anxiety since i was 21 years old, and am in my late 40's now. other anti-depressants caused horrible cravings for sweets and carbs. plus the medications didn't work that well for me. i have been on effexor for 8 months, 150 mg. it works wonders for me. i actually like to be around people now. i go places etc... i have a life again, and noticed that i get excited about life. also, i have lost weight on it. my cravings are gone, i feel full after a meal and full a lot longer after the meal. i am gaining back my energy. i am a woman who was so severely depressed, i couldn't even get out of my recliner, and didn't get dressed most days. what a difference!"	-10
217652	"we started strattera 10mg then 18mg then 25mg for our 9yr old. in the beginning it was great, after about 5 days of each dose it was clearly time to increase to the next dose, but now we have been at 25 mg for over a month and the impulsivity and anger has gotten worse again over the past 2 weeks or so, and we can't increase the dose any further. will be calling her doctor monday to change to something else. an alarming thing to me is that she is also sad and crying a whole lot, which is new. this child never cried before."	-10
108159	"first week i felt fatigue and almost stopped taking it. but i wasn't sure if it was the medicine or something else going on? also almost immediately i had no desire to drink alcohol, i was in the habit of drinking wine almost daily. so this was amazing to me. (reading more, it's also used for stop smoking and drinking, well that certainly happened for me) i've been taking it for about 2 months and i've lost 15 pounds and i'm also following a low carb diet too. i also found that my mood improved too...i feel less moody and just calmer and happier....which is making my boyfriend very happy. lol, i'm in my early 50's so i think i was going through the change and it was affecting my moods. overall....it's been working great for me."	-10
132019	"this drug decreased my hot flushes by 2/3. i figured it would be 100% but that was probably an unreasonable expectation. i've gone from 8-12 a day to 2-3. i've suffered hot flushes since 1998 and the past 6 months they have only gotten more frequent and very annoying. my husband says i'm nicer to live with after taking effexor, so now i realize i really was irritable from the lack of sleep and night sweats this past year. i tend to forget names or words more frequently but am not sure if the foggy brain has another cause."	-10
128083	"i've been taking phentermine 37.5 for a while now, since june 7, it is now july 20 and i have only lost 8 pounds. i don't have an appetite at all, i have to force myself to eat, i think it's only like 1000 calories a day if that. i have really bad heart burn and have some insomnia, other than that i haven't experienced anything else. i am 5'6 and started off weighing 180, i'm down to 172. i did have an episode of jitters, tingly arms, rapid heartbeat, and cold sweats but i ate an apple and i felt much better. i'm not sure if the pill is actually helping me lose weight, since i've been on it for 44 days and have only lost 8 pounds."	-10
230518	"i'm 15 and got the shot about 2 months ago. so far, my periods have remained regular. on the downside, i now feel hungry all the time. all i do is eat.. i have these irresistible cravings now. i'm noticing weight gain of course because i'm stuffing my face, but i'm miserable if i don't eat what i'm craving or when i'm hungry. also, i've been having excruciating headaches. i already have migraines. i had them for years, before i got on the shot. but they had stopped when i started a new medicine. now they're back since i'm on the shot. it's terrible, hopefully the cravings, appetite, headaches, and also these mood swings i've been having get better. if not i'm switching."	-10
40473	"i have just weaned off cymbalta and started savella about 3 weeks ago. be careful of your judgements on side effects of savella. many of us are being weaned off medicines like cymbalta and others and these can be causing the side effects. coming off cymbalta can cause dizziness, feeling &quot;weird&quot; and many others. before you write off savella, make sure your side effects are not withdrawal from other medicines. i have found if i take savella on an empty stomach, i am nauseated, so take with food. i also have moved the second dose of the day to 2 pm and that helped decrease the insomnia. i have more energy than before, but find i am a bit edgy at times and this is fading. smaller doses may help side effects. insurance should cover-ask for appeal if denied."	-10
59337	"i was suffering really bad with my sinuses over the weekend and could find any relief. the doctor told me in the past to take claritin, but it has never helped. i was at work this morning and my co worker told me about zyrtec. actually she had one for me to try and within 30 minutes, i could feel the pressure letting up in my sinus areas and what a surprise, i could breathe so much better, no sneezing, dripping, coughing, horrible pressure in my sinuses. i was astonished that this little pill could work so effectively. i have to say that i feel like a totally different person today, thanks to zyrtec. if you haven't ever tried it, be sure to, it is the best of the best. i love you zyrtec!"	-10
139426	"unlike all the other comments i have read, i work at night and drive a truck for a living. i go to work at midnight and drive all night and into the next day. i heard about nuvigil and went to my doctor and he prescribed it to me. of course the insurance company wanted an explanation to pay for it. i haven't had much success with it, i guess because i only take it when i have a long night ahead of me. it has worked well for me about 1 out of 5 times. i will be talking to my doctor and see if i need to take it everyday. but, with my schedule, shift work that varys and reversing my schedule when i am not working at night on my days off, is really different than most of what i have read on here. maybe i need to find me a day job!"	-10
93342	"i am bipolar and have major depression issues and have been on tons of meds, to the point where i have felt like a pin cushion for these meds. either they make me so tired i can't do nothing or they just don't work. i started taking brintellix 3 months ago and i am on 10 mg a day. side effects, whether i took it with food or not i would throw up almost every day ugh.....but on the up side it has made me feel like me again, not miserable and naggy looking at everything in a negative way! the nausea is still there sometimes in the morning but i will take it. so i can cope with everyday issues without freaking out and to be somewhat at peace with myself."	-10
216009	"i did a review a month ago about the insertion, this review is just an update how the cooper iud paragard is working for me for my first month, every girl concern: sex is great he doesn't feel it, i don't feel it or get any discomfort during intercourse. menstrual: for my surprise my period is the same, is not heavier, i don't have abnormal cramps, just the usual ones for the first or second day, days are the same for me, overall every person and every body reacts different but to have your own experience you just have to try it, for me has been the best bc i have used.. don't just judge the iud based on what you read and give it try. 10yrs of no worries is worth it.. :)"	-10
122808	"after my wellness checkup and blood analysis, i was told by my md to start taking vit. d3-2000 daily. i took it as recommended for 2 days and i noticed that i was experiencing dizziness, tiredness and really bad cramps in my hands, feet and legs. i thought that i was dehydrated and drank more water. the cramps kept getting worse and i also started having increased palpitations and more dizziness. as the only change i had made in my daily regimen was taking the d3, i decided to stop taking it to see if it might be the cause. sure enough, these symptoms disappeared. so, why are we being told to take this? several of my friends and family have been advised to do the same lately. is it a new &quot;health&quot; sham?"	-10
156207	i took cialis for the first time four days ago and have had nasal congestion and flu like symptoms.	-10
88330	"so i was recently diagnosed with adhd and am taking welbutrin however it wasn't doing enough so i requested to try a stimulant, specifically this one since the ratings are so high and predominately positive. within minutes of taking 10mg the anxiety was... just wayy too much. i also didn't really know how to feel or what to do. it did help me with focusing...better than almost anything else i've tried. then after that i went away about a half an hour later i started to feel better after i ate something. the remainder of the day i was so tired i just layed in bed. it works don't get me wrong but i just cant put my faith in an addictive/phisically dependant med. i stopped taking it. gonna try strattera next"	-10
50558	i love this medicine. i used to get incredibly anxious at night - nothing could help me. my doctor prescribed this and the first night i felt better. my mind was not cycling through &quot;scary&quot; thoughts that used to plague me. i was able to rationalize much easier. i'm just so glad to finally have something that helps.	-10
148442	"i got mirena back in december 2016 and ever since that day i've been bleeding every single day. we are now in august and bleeding is still occurring non stop. it has taken a toll on my daily life especially with my sex life with my husband. this is devastating because i was under the impression it'll stop my periods within 6 months the latest, it's been 9 months now and starting birth control on top of the iud to see if it works if not i will have to remove it and bleed a couple more weeks and mess up my system even more."	-10
170781	"take pill, fall asleep within 20 minutes."	-10
44604	"i was taking this pill for a month and i started getting very moody, tired and then i started getting very depressed. i was depress to the point that i used to start crying suddenly without no reason. i am usually a very happy and positive person."	-10
85504	i absolutely love this birth control pill. i have a tubal ligation and i was prescribed birth control pills to help keep my cycles less painful and keep my cervix thin. i used to have very painful cycles to the point that i could not work on the 2nd day of my cycle. i was recently on the junel birth control but i continued to spot for 5 months and that was sooooooooo aggravating. i was very hesitant about starting a new birth control because my body had to get used to another pill but my doctor told me i had to be on some type to keep my cervix thin. so i decided to follow her advice and it worked instantly. i had to continue to take my junel and then start on sprintec pills the following week. this is a lifesaver and i finally feel great.	-10
222097	be patient it does take a few days for the symptoms to clear but after about 4 days you should see improvement. there is a topical cream your dr can provide that helps with burning and itching. to ease pain soak in cool water frequently... but it may take up to 7 days to clear.	-10
115223	"1st prescribed &quot;valium&quot; upon cancer diagnosis. gp was concerned about my anxiety and especially my ability to sleep with this news. he was right, sleep nearly impossible. pill worked for me, but initially took 10 mg (especially the first night) to have any effect. i take half a 5mg (2.5 mg) occasionally for general insomnia (had for 10 years before cancer) and especially at night before surgeries/procedures, (8 in &lt; 2 yrs). afraid to take higher doses because i react poorly to medicines in general and problems with anesthesia the next day. have to switch off with another medicine when this stops being effective."	-10
76744	"i've been taking belviq for two years. slowly i lost 30 pounds. i have continued to take this medication and the most important detail is that i have kept my weight loss off as belviq works perfectly for weight maintenance too. (i can't tell you how many times, prior to belviq, that i'd gained and lost this weight.) very much helps me with cravings and over eating."	-10
217750	while taking strattera it didn't really help with my adhd but it did cause unwanted nausea and once i reached my target 80mg dose i began to get extremely hot then started to sweat a lot and finally threw up the strattera.	-10
188121	this cream caused red skin syndrome. it ruined my life as i had to go through the most horrendous drug withdrawal just to get off it. 31 months off it and still not normal. look up topical steroid addiction and withdrawal before deciding whether you want to risk 3 years plus of your life. awful	-10
165734	"i was nervous to get mirena after reading reviews, but my doc strongly encouraged for medical reasons. about 3.5 months ago i got the iud inserted. while i survived, i'm still haunted by how painful it was. there was a slight complication (apparently my uterus was tilted so the 1st attempt at insertion failed &amp; she had to give me a numbing shot in the vag &amp; adjust my uterus) the 2nd attempt succeeded but the cramps were so intense. cramps lasted 2 days &amp; i bled for 2 weeks straight. after that my period came normal but lasted a couple days extra. my last period was slightly lighter than usual so i'm hoping it drops off soon. so far it's been worth the pain bc periods are more bearable, it's super effective &amp; nice to not worry about a pill"	-10
26832	firstly yes it worked however after my experience i think this pill should be illegal! it messed me up and i now regret taking it. it said on the leaflet your next period may be a few days late and if any longer than 7 to do a pregnancy test) i did not get my period so i did tests.. all negative.. 3 months later.. finally got a period and the pain was just horrific. i will never take a pill like this again. horrible horrible thing!	-10
211878	"hi i'm grace, i've been taking lamotrigine for about six months now&hellip; i absolutely despise it&hellip; it really doesn't work for my epilepsy i have been trying to get it changed for months now but my neurologist is hard to get appointments with. i still have my seizures at least 5 times a day and because it really doesn't work it's hard to remember to take it sometimes but i almost always take it. it also made me gain some weight and not be able to lose it. i don't recommend this medicine"	-10
209408	"i have had migraines since the age of 27. now 62 and still get them. i have been taking zomig for the past 10 years and they are the only tablet that have helped me. at first the dosage was 5mg. and was bought down to 2.5mg as the side effects made me feel as though my arms and chest were really heavy and was accompanied by a very dry mouth and was not able to drink anything hot. sometimes i get very tired the day before the migraine hits and i know its time for a zomig. i still get these sensations but not all of the time. i pay $36.45 every month 6 tablets, expensive but it works. my only worry now is that after the age of 65 it is not advisable to take them. i wonder what am i going to do?"	-10
48342	"i had a bad injury years ago resulting in a rather large prescription for hydrocodine. so i was like awesome a legal script. little did i know just how quickly i could become dependent. soon it was oxy, roxy, morphine, luckily no needles. then it was all my free time, money, payday advances, check cashing, pure misery to just feel normal and not ill, i'm sure many have been through it. i had heard about a clinic close by and it took away all the daily stress, and saved me probably 1000s of dollars. hours of time, and supervised help. it was my choice. i'm at 160 mg so it will be a while before i'm completely free, but the progress i've made already is unbelievable i've even told my parents. best choice ever."	-10
204868	my son was only 4 when he was diagnosed with cluster migraines. the diagnosis came after a year because they rarely occur in children that young. the horror of hearing him scream &quot;mommy help me! help me! why does my head hurt!!&quot; broke my heart. our pediarician recommended a drug that controls seizures but sometimes actually causes seizures. nope was my answer. next he recommended periactin. with little side effects and my sons headaches cycling one per day for 4 days i agreed. it was the best decision we ever made. as long as he takes his med he has no headaches at all. it has been the best blessing ever and given him a normal pain free life!!!!	-10
117252	i was unable to use it because of side effects. (1) 2 days after beginning it i experienced fast heart rate i stopped using it for two weeks. (2) when i resumed use one of my eyes became very painful. i used the drops for only 3 days. the cost of $95 was too much for me.	-10
35256	"i had been suffering from what i thought to be bronchitis for several months. i would cough sputum for about 1/2 hour in the morning when i awoke and after i laid down at night. i've tried over the counter and another antibiotic from the doctor. after going back to the doctor because nothing was working, he prescribed levofloxacin, 500 mg/daily. within a few days i could tell the infection was clearing. within a week, the coughing and sputum was gone."	-10
7923	it is the greatest drug found. it works very well if used as prescribed.	-10
148057	"i really wanted to have a more positive experience on errin, but it just wasn't a good fit for me. after a month bi-weekly periods, i started spotting every other week and as a result it felt like i was constantly pmsing. i gained about 8 pounds of water weight and i felt uncomfortable and bloated almost all day every day. lastly, i just didn't feel like myself on errin. i would get very inconvenienced by small things, it made me very emotional, and it was even hard to get out of bed in the morning some days. it also kept my psoriasis breakouts pretty constant. i asked my doc if i could take some time off instead of starting a new pack and within 5 days i was back to a normal weight, skin cleared, and felt like myself."	-10
57173	"i've tried a lot of cholesterol-lowering meds, but can't usually tolerate them for more than a month. unfortunately, triplix gave me the same side effects--dizziness, digestive miseries, etc. it's probably a wonderful drug for a lot of people, just not for me. i don't know if it made a difference in my cholesterol levels."	-10

226500	"first couple of months i had a longer then usual period. after about 2 months in it completely stopped although i had light craps and mood swings through out the first couple of months no weight gain. perks of having the implant, not having to worry about missed pills (although i was never good at taking pill form birth control) no shot and yet still having periods ! all around the implants been good to me. would highly recommend it to anyone with an irregular period!!! haha good luck ladies!"	-10
148054	i have only been on jolivette for a month after my daughter was born. first of all she is 2 months old and in that entire time i have been on a period except for 3 days of very light spotting. i feel like i'm going to bleed forever. it's not heavy it just doesn't stop. it also made my milk supply low which has me supplementing with formula and i have never had acne this bad in my life. my entire face is covered! i am stopping use of this pill immediately. i would rather use condoms than deal with this nonsense. i'm having to use them anyway since you have to take the pill the same time everyday and i always forget. if i wanna get back on the pill i'll take a normal one in 4-6 months when i'm done breast feeding.	-10
181750	"i took this with bupropion. i stopped bupropion, because i was so edgy and irritable. it was suggested i wait for prozac to take full effect in about 1 month. i stopped prozac last night after a week of it alone. i was edgy, irritable, and didn't feel like doing productive things like care about my job, or care about studying on investing choices. i just wanted to take a nap to relieve the buzzing in my head. today i am not taking anything. i feel better than yesterday."	-10

218599	"originally i was prescribed ortho tri cyclen but due to insurance issues i was given tri sprintec. i know you're supposed to give things usually 2-3 months to work but let me tell you this pill has worked miracles! the first 3 weeks were terrible. i was breaking out even worse than i already was. i mean, i was getting acne right above my eyelids, underneath my eye, &amp; just about everywhere else on my face. i was so nauseous for a couple days that i almost had to skip a wedding. but i am so glad i stuck to this. my face has been the clearest it's been in a year. i'm still battling 1-2 zits but that's nothing compared to what it was. i am left with a lot of dark spots but a few hydrafacial treatments should help with that."	-10
202332	"recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been treated with lithium for a little over 30 days. received results from blood work and increased dosage. only side effect i notice are vivid nightmares. they're just dreams, so i'm not really concerned. i still struggle with anger from time to time, or short fits of rage, followed by regret and self loathing, a common cycle for me. trying to remain optimistic. finding myself wanting to isolate more and more. i know this is not healthy. looking for some positive feedback and/or suggestions. thanks"	-10
140651	"lexapro made me very tired all the time. i needed a daily midday nap. i'm a college student so i was able to sleep at odd periods of the day, but it was ridiculous. i could get a solid 10 hours of sleep at night but by 1 pm i'd be dead tired. one time i was late picking up a kid i used to babysit from her elementary school because i fell asleep and slept through my alarm in the middle of the afternoon!! i was never the type who could take naps until i started lexapro. i didn't stay on it for more than 6 months because being that tired all the time was ruining my social life, grades, work life, the list goes on."	-10
162220	"i found the reviews helpful, in march i had a shot of cortisone in my right knee. it was effective for 5 months. when my pain returned the doctor recommended ortho visc. i had 3 treatments, each a week apart, i had relief after a few days, but it didn't last. i had the final injection on august 30th. it really hurt, and i was light-headed afterwards, and could hardly walk. the pa that gave me the last treatment had me rest until i felt ok to walk and drive. he told me to mark 3 weeks on the calendar, at which time i would feel no pain. (did that mean i would be dead?!) after 8 days i am almost pain free! now to see how long it lasts."	-10

49052	"i'm 33, w/no kids. i've been on a couple diff types of bc before but i think this one has been the worst. started taking these pills because i was cramping a lot during my period and they were heavier than usual. it was fine for the 1st 3 mths, w/little to no side effects, my periods even seemed less painful and lighter. 6 mths later, i've noticed that i'm super emotional/sad, periods are inconsistent, 1 month its heavy w/break thru bleeding for about 4-5 days, spotting for about 2 weeks before and or even after my period, the next month i may not bleed much at all and the cramping hasn't decreased. i've also noticed an in increase in the frequency of bad headaches and a lack of energy. wouldn't recommend aubra but everyone is different."	-10
120514	"start the pills with no issue, days 1 and 2 blood sugar is consistent with what i had been seeing. day 3 blood sugar is improved, nothing above 127 all day! toward the end of the day i get killer headache and can't move my fingers/wrist. before i get home to the test strips i know i've got diabetic ketoacidoais with a blood sugar of 127! i will not be giving farxiga another attempt at killing me."	-10
187850	"i started out sooo pro-nexplanon. i got it inserted in jan. 2016 and it was great. in june 2016 i got diagnosed with major depression and anxiety, which i have never struggled with before. since then i've felt un-human. detached, emotionless, fatigued, i haven't felt love for something in over a year. i figured it was just bad luck until a couple of weeks ago when my body started rejecting every thing i ate. i'm choking down mashed potatoes as i type, but i know they'll come back up later. i looked into other reviews and i guess severe depression and constant nausea are two common things with nexplanon. i'll be getting it removed asap :("	-10
131653	"i took this pill one day and that was all i needed to, i took it at 5:30 pm and was fine, until i wanted to sleep. i tossed and turned all night, my heart racing, i was literally so tired but my mind just would not shut down. those things they call brain zaps are terrifying, do not take this."	-10

201262	i started this only 25mg been on it 23 days and have had episodes of anxiety sitting at home some days. but my bp goes up when i have an attack. anyone else have this happen and when i'm relaxed my pulse rate is around 69-70 but when i'm not its around 99-115. dr wants me to stay on it this dose another 30 days as i'm sensitive to meds i also take valium for meiner's but it's never helped my anxiety.	-10
199914	first off everybody will not experience the same side effects from using chantix. as for me i'm glad i decided to take it. i noticed the medication started working about day 8. cigarettes made me slightly nauseated. they slowly became less satisfying and desirable. the urges by then to smoke were minimal and withdrawals were none from the start. i did have some nausea in the beginning after taking the pill that went away after a few minutes. other than that no noticeable side effects. i'm just now starting week 4. the urge to smoke now is completely gone. i don't feel like i ever want to smoke again.	-10
77408	"after taking fosamax for 5 years i was prescribed prolia in june 2013, i have been hospitalised on 4 occasions with back spasms so severe it took over 2 hrs to get me in the ambulance fully medicated, i then spent 8-10 days in hospital each time waiting for the spasms to stop, after being discharged each time had to use a walker for a week because i couldn't stand longer than a few steps because of the damage the spasms had caused. no doctor has been able to give me answers until 4 days ago after spending another day in hospital because i spent 2 hrs on the floor in a shopping centre that prolia is more than likely the reason. i also have ankles which are the size of the tops of my legs, this too has only been in the last 3yrs"	-10
86424	"i have been taking invokana for about 5 months and i feel great!! my a1c went from 9.8 to 7.4 in 3 months. the only side effects i have noticed is some weight loss. but the weight loss stopped. it does make me really thirsty, small price to pay for controlled blood sugar levels."	-10
153084	"i've been using it for 3 weeks, whilst also using cetaphil, moisturising, exercising, drinking a lot of water. it hasn't helped that much at all, it seemed to work, but all the acne is still winning. after 4 weeks i'm ditching it if i see no significant improvements"	-10
170245	"i was prescribed it for my borderline personality disorser and i find it definitely addictive in a way of sleep! i have become dependent on it due to its sedative values (which really does help if u struggle with insomnia, major anxiety at night and racing thoughts when alone) however i don't feel it has calmed or helped any other aspects of the disorder it just allows me to sleep. there is no magic pill but this i feel normally would work better along side therapy and perhaps other meds for different aspects. as a lone medication i haven't found it overly productive other than i already specified."	-10
191277	i developed severe shoulder pain in both shoulders after about 5 days. the doctor assured me it wasn't the vyvanse. well after 2 weeks of severe pain i thought i'd do my own google search and found plenty of people complaining about vyvanse causing joint pain. i stopped taking vyvanse as soon as i read these forums where people described their joint pain. after 3 days 80% of the pain was gone and it took about a month before 95% was gone. my left shoulder now 'clicks' and often i wake up and my left shoulder is in a position where it's very painful. i wish the doctor would go over all side effects when then prescribe medication so you know when something starts to happen that it is the medication.	-10
135590	"have been on intuniv for about a month now. i feel like i have been crawling out of my skin and emotionally very upset. i feel at times i could break down in tears over a commercial, or when my kids hug me and tell me they love me. i am normally a emotionally reserved man and keep them in check because of my line of work. i really do feel like i am going nuts on this medication. i have officially stopped taking the medication until i can talk with my doctor."	-10
27761	"i used to suffer from panic attacks frequently that made me feel like i was constantly about to faint or have a heart attack. it was so bad at one point i couldn't leave the house. i was extremely worried about taking this (probably as a result of gad i was diagnosed with) but i've been on lexapro since november last year and haven't had a panic attack since! it was hard getting used to lexapro at first and i experienced visual hallucinations upon waking up, but a small dose of valium helped take the edge off. now anxiety isn't interfering with my daily life and i barely think about it. i'm now learning meditation, cbt and looking after my physical health so i can wean off the drug later in the year when i'm mentally ready for it"	-10

157533	"i inherited cystic acne from my father. he had severe cystic acne and was prescribed it immediately after it was approved by the fda. it was amazing, it cleared his acne completely, but the side affects were pretty significant. i developed cystic acne as a teenager, and it never let up. i wanted to take accutane, but being a woman, doctors were hesitant because of the birth defects it caused. i pursued it and finally found a doctor willing to prescribe it, but i had to be on birth control and be monitored. i was in my early twenties. i experienced severe skin dryness, headaches, and some minor hair loss. it was pretty uncomfortable, but i don't regret it at all. it was like a decade of bad skin was wiped out with one four month treatment."	-10

84359	"do not take this bc . worst bc ever . i wish i would've listened to the reviews. this bc ruined 72 hours of my life this week. horrible side effects after just 3 days. irritable, annoyed with everything , loud noises hurt my head ,light hurt my eyes , and i was snapping at my husband for any little thing he said or did . horrible stomach issues . watery poop (sorry tmi) in the middle of the night like at 2am 3 am having to sit on the toilet for 30 min . 3rd day i called my ob for a new brand to start. i can't continue this bc . i refuse to feel like feel 1 more day. compare pros and cons of other bc's. i might add this was free through insurance if i had to pay 200$ or more a month i would pay the 200$ vs taking this 1 that is free."	-10
9932	"the first 2-3 months were amazing, some spotting but it took my period from 7 days to 4 days, less cramping, not so heavy. there was menstrual cramping but not like before. when i missed my first pill i figured &quot;meh maybe 2 days of spotting&quot; boy was i wrong, my period has lasted a week and half with cramping and somewhat of heavy flow (very annoying) then again (my fault) i missed another pill, and now i've had my period for a month (&amp; counting) not my cup of tea. when i didn't have insurance i was paying almost $100 out of pocket, and now that i do i don't think i want to take it anymore. everybody is different, i'm just a forgetful person &amp; is the reason for my month long period."	-10
