# Drug Rating Classifier using Neural Networks and Sentimental Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project involves building a drug rating classifier using neural networks to predict ratings (0 or 1) based on user reviews provided by a medicine company. The aim is to help the company understand their customers better by analyzing product reviews. The provided training, development, and test datasets are used to train, validate, and evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## Files Included:
- train.tsv: Training dataset containing user reviews and corresponding ratings.
- dev.tsv: Development dataset for validation purposes.
- test.tsv: Unlabeled test dataset for which predictions need to be made and submitted.

## Code Structure:
- Data preprocessing: Reading and cleaning the training, development, and test datasets.
- Model implementation: Building and training the neural network classifier using suitable architectures.
- Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the classifier on the development dataset to fine-tune parameters.
- Prediction: Generating predictions for the unlabeled test dataset.

## Model Selection:
The classifier is implemented using neural networks, which include various architectures such as DNN (Deep Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The choice of neural network architecture depends on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset.

## Evaluation Criteria:
The performance of the classifier is evaluated based on the F1-weighted score.
