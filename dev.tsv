227093	i got my nexplanon in december 2013. two weeks after i got the implant i began bleeding. but not so much bleeding as heavy spotting. and it has lasted for months. it'd disappear for only a few days at a time and come right back. i think that's been the worst part. now in june 2014, i think the spotting is starting to subside. thank goodness. i've read a lot of reviews of girls saying they lost their sex drive. i think mine actually increased. i've also gained a little weight. 5-10 lbs. my breasts grew too. and they're tender a lot. a new side effect that's gotten pretty out of control lately has been my mood swings (i cry over any little thing, i'm emotional about everything) and the nausea (not fun).	1
219510	prescribed before and after cataract surgery with good results, decreased itching, tearing, reddening, which lessened the urge to rub eyes post surgery. only drawback for me, must be used daily or you are back to square one. did not interfere with post surgery meds. it does have a cost factor.	1
199407	i'm just finishing up my first month on the shot and i can honestly say that it's working well. this is my first birth control i've had, and there have only been a couple of side effects. i spotted for about 5 days twice within the first 3 months which isn't bad. but i also experienced some vaginal dryness that required additional foreplay as well as lube at times. overall i think it's fine considering i don't have to remember it and the spotting i heard gets better over time. i'm due for my next shot in a couple of weeks after which i'll offer another review. so this isn't a bad choice, but with any birth control there are side effects.	1
160884	took this medication for 4 months it didn't do much but help me sleep. i experienced lactation, enlarged breasts &quot;went from a b cup to a double d&quot; hunger to the point that i never felt full no matter what i ate, obsessive sweating, and the worst thing was that i gained 40lbs in 4 months. i was originally 130lbs and topped off at 170lbs and flushed the remaining medication and had zero withdrawals. unfortunately this was 3 years ago and no matter what i do i can not lose more than 10lbs and i gain it back off and on. i am getting my thyroid tested to check if it caused it to be come inactive or under active. because i have never weighed more than 135lbs even after having 3 full term babies. this medication should be removed from the market!!!	0
33397	i think if you already had some underlying issue like i had, teribble pms and painful periods, and you felt terrible mood swings etc without bc, then this pill seems to work well. it seems like women who have minor pms and such don't do well with this one. but i have felt amazing since starting it. i barely have a period and no pms. no pms !!!! i haven't had any mood issues or hormonal issues since starting it . i have noticed my breast more full which is welcome. only real side effect was naseau for the first 1.5 weeks in morning and evening which wasnt fun. i feel great on it.	1
133274	2 weeks in i've got the worst breakout i've had in years. also nausea and stomach pains. i prefer ortho tri-lo -- didn't have any of these side effects on that one.	0
119980	i have had high blood pressure for about 10 years. i was first put on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide and was on that for about 5 years. i had a chronic cough while on that, but i tolerated it since it controlled my blood pressure well. it was usually around 115/75. i finally asked my doctor if i could try a different medicine, and he gave me losartan (50 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide(12.5). i have had absolutely no side effects and my blood pressure is consistently in the 115/75 range.	1
46664	gleevec has been a miracle drug for me, the side effects are minimal when you consider the outcome, if you don't take it. thanks very much to the inventer of this medication.	1
2404	helped me with my blood sugar levels and i lost 10 lbs. in a month. down side, horrible stomach pain 24/7, nausea and diarrhea. doctor is changing my medicines.	0
191064	campral worked as prescribed for me, it gives me relief from the cravings, i didn't feel it was working until i realised that for the first time in years i had reached two weeks with out a drink, the habitual side of drinking is powerful and every time i was triggered it felt on par with a craving. my advice, keep with the campral even if you feel its not working, give it time, let it do its thing, it will alleviate the cravings which will give you some breathing space to work on the habit itself, my synopsis, campral will help with half the battle the rest needs counselling, will power and time. side effects minimal for me, campral is an excellent tool to stay on the road to recovery, one in my opinion not recommended enough.	1
31330	well, my yi is gone, but i'm fairly certain that's because my entire vagina has been burned off. i had no ice pack so i used a bag of frozen veggies and sat with them down there for an hour before the intense &quot;omg, who lit a fire down there&quot; burning ended. seriously, unless you like feeling like your vagina has been set on fire, do not use this product.	0
16203	my worst problem with this pill was the weight gain. 15 pounds in 2 months. no change in diet and i have been excercising more - another issue was the breakout bleeding for no reason. i had one month where i had a week of bleeding (7 full days ) then 7 days off, then another 7 days of bleeding - again for no reason, pill taken at the same time daily, etc. i am going off of this after 4 months. i think everyone reacts differently but my doctor said this pill specifically did not have these side effects and i think i could deal with the insomnia ( although annoying) but unfortunately i cannot afford a whole new wardrobe and the weight gain is unacceptable.	0
8273	this drug will knock you out for sure, but it has some really crazy side effects that i didn't think would actually happen to me, mainly doing stuff that i don't remember at all -- one night i made an extremely hefty online purchase and had no recollection of it. i also &quot;drunk text&quot; on ambien, or otherwise say things verbally to people that i don't remember. this has happened a number of times and actually caused a lot of problems in my last relationship. i've woken up literally covered in food. it also worsened my depression. not a great experience.	0
203232	i've been taking it for about 2 months now. the first month was terrible only because of my body adjusting to the new hormone levels. i had break through bleeding for two week, my breasts were so sore the entire month, and i had cramps/back pains almost every day. my period was a breeze though. no cramps, no breast pain, very light flow, and no acne! my second month has been amazing. it's helped control mood swings and the sense of anxiety and depression i get when seratonin levels drop around my period. the only thing i have to complain about is the sense of bloating i have. it goes away though when i avoid all of the salty foods and processed sugars i crave. other than that, i really enjoy this product. everyone's bodies are different.	1
73801	took for 5 months. first 4 months great. then got intermittent tingling and numbess in arms. over next month tingling went to constant throbbing. pain shooting down right arm. stopped pill. it has been 7 days and left arm back to normal. right arm slight numbness and some discomfort but getting much better. be aware of symptoms!	0
38318	did absolutely nothing to help with the burning or pain. just made me queasy and turned my pee highlighter orange. total waste of $5.	0
196841	thanks to paxil (paroxetine) my life got basically destroyed. i was depressed before taking it, yes, but i hadn't mood swings, 0 emotions, sexual disfunctions, cognitive issues, tremors, memory not working. i feel like an empty shell. avoid please	0
44050	i tried this for two months and i cannot take it anymore. the only reason i wanted to be on birth control was so i could know exactly when my period would start, without the pill i would never be consistent. i tried lo-estrin24, which caused me to spot and so my doctor thought i needed something a little stronger, so she prescribed me this. since i have been on it, my mom and i got in a huge fight causing us not to talk for 2 weeks, i isolated my friends and got emotionally attached to a guy, which never happens and i have been eating like crazy. my breasts are huge, weight increased and i was nauseous for a week straight, not to mention the whole point of me taking this was to know when my period was, well i never started when the pill said i should.	0
206754	i went to the doctors about my acne and she prescribed me this gel. i used it on my face the first night i got it and it was fine, woke up with a few red patches but overall thought it worked well, applied it on the second night and i woke up to severe redness and itchiness on my face as well as big dry patches on my cheeks, chin and forehead. turns out i had an allergic reaction to this gel which has left my sensitive skin unbearable to look at. it has caused my eyes to swell up and itching still persists.	0
29295	i was put on 25mg twice daily of topiramate. i had horrendous side effects, i managed to take this drug for 2 weeks however after the first week i had to decrease my dose to 25mg as day as i hadn't slept properly for nearly 4 days. i completely lost my appetite. i had terrible mood swings and irritability. i found it extremely difficult to concentrate and struggled remembering things. my doctors told me to persevere with this drug as i wasn't getting migraines with the 50mg dose but couldn't tolerate the side effects. after being on 25mg for a few days i woke up one morning and near enough collapsed and felt very unsteady on my feet, went to see my doctor and they took me straight off it due to a bad reaction.	0
53971	i started using the men's 5% about a year ago when it was recommended by my dermatologist. i was losing handfuls of hair in shower and when combing. my part became so wide and the crown of my head had thinned drastically. i became depressed and it was all i could think about. i decided to try the minoxidil. after three months i really noticed a difference. i had lots of new growth and my hair loss stopped. now the thinning is no where as noticeable as it once was. my hair dresser told me i had lots of new growth and that my hair felt so much thicker. the only negatives are that i do have an increase in facial hair that i have to deal with often and that some of the regrowth is course. even with those, i would not discontinue using it.	1
39142	i started contrave last saturday may 6, 2017. the first couple of days i felt depressed, my head felt a little weird, and i was mildly nauseous. by monday, i felt a lot better. i'm still on just one pill a day. the only issue i'm having is at night when i go to bed i kinda feel like my heart is racing a little bit. has anyone else experienced that? so far that's my only concern. i have had dry mouth but that's tolerable. my starting weight was 184ish and this morning i weighed 180.4 which was encouraging.	1
202346	my whole life i have struggled with bipolar disorder having unstable moods and severe bipolar depression. i have been on tons of different medications for it. all of them has crazy side effects and none seemed to work. a month ago i got prescribed lithium and it seems to be working super well. i don't have as much up and down moods and i notice my racing thoughts have gone away for the most part. things that used to bother me barely bother me anymore and i kind of just go with the flow of things now. the only down side of this medication is it makes me feel a little irritated at times and doesn't help with my anxiety as i was hoping. but as for bipolar disorder, i highly recommend this medication.	1
20391	increased depression causing extreme irritability, excessive muscular spasms with cramps in lower limbs.	0
169996	this has definitely helped with my impulsiveness and mood dysregulation. my life used to be uttermost chaos. in and out of hospitals, constantly in er's for suicide attempts and self harm needing stitches.... this got me to the point where i can think clearly enough to actually start making changes in my life and deal with my emotions and behaviours.	1
212653	very high smoking sensation, weight gain, tiredness, and insomnia. but its the best antipsychotic med for me.	1
220141	absolutely the worst medicine i have ever been on. i've been on antidepressants for years and they all suppressed my emotions. i was on trazodone for depression/chronic insomnia but unfortunately the medicine quit working for me so my doctor prescribed me amitriptyline 25mg and when i tell you every single horrible emotion was brought forward, i'm not even lying. everyone around me noticed a difference and i felt trapped but was expressing externally. i had a psychotic break on this medication however i was not suocidal. if i had the power to take this medicine off the market, i'm sorry i would. the range of emotions i had was sadness to anger to agitation and it was on a repeat cycle and i couldn't control it no matter how much i wanted to	0
129786	i took this pill within 24 hours after me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex. it was during my fertile days. i received light bleeding within a week. and two weeks later, i got my actual period. the waiting was crucial!! i experienced bloating, dizziness, and extreme fatigue. don't stress over it, that could delay your period. thank god my boyfriend was extremely supportive!!	1
145181	i used to be an extremely bubbly, happy, and very sexual person. i've had the nexplanon for a little over a month and my weight has stayed almost the same (i went from 140-135). i'm very active and generally up for anything. after having the nexplanon implanted i've been miserable. i have at least 2/3 anxiety attacks weekly, i'm moody, hateful, irritable and downright not myself. my poor boyfriend is trying to be a trooper but i can barely contain my own feelings :( my sex drive is gone whereas previously i was craving sex twice a day! i don't feel like myself. i had my period for 2 straight weeks after implantation and now i'm bleeding very lighting continuously. i'm giving it a couple more weeks before i call to have it removed :(	0
138549	i started taking it because i was always hungry and gained 12 pounds in the last month. with a stressful job, i had lack of motivation. day 3 today and down 5lbs woohoo. also working out to julian michaels 30 day shred. only dry mouth, and i feel great and hunger has stalled. i have 40 pounds to go. i love this pill.	1
865	probably the worst medication i've ever taken. it had very little effect on my prostate but gave me swollen sinuses, blurry vision, fatigue, muscular weakness, retrograde ejaculation and no ejaculation.	0
106261	this is the worse birth control ever. i was on it for 2 years and 4 months.. everything was fine for the first year then after that i slowly started to get acne 1-2 spots every day for that year. then the last 4 months of being on it i started to get so many white heads around my cheeks and jawline &amp; it started to make the acne soo bad like 10 pimples every where every day. not even make up would cover it nothing helped. it made my face so bad. it also made me loose a lot of hair, thinned my hair out and made me eat heaps, i gained a lot of weight. as soon as i got off it i haven't gotten any pimples since, no hair loss and i don't eat like i did on it. i wouldn't recommended it for anyone, i'm now stuck with scars waiting to fade.	0
32869	my first two months on it were not really good - i had constant spotting since 2 weeks from start, and i was quite moody and sensitive. only good thing was my acne cleared up. then i missed one pill on accident and got full blown period in 2days and i was like - nope, that's it, i give up, but my obgyn told me &quot;try to finish the box and then if it continues the same with 2nd box we can try something else&quot; and boy, am i glad i did. after that &quot;period&quot; spotting never returned, box is finished, moodiness is gone, skin still clear and my scheduled period was completely painless for first time in my life. so i'm super happy with it now.	1
103557	at first the pill was great, helped with the bleeding and regulate my period. then i slowly began getting depressed and i had to stop taking this pill. i've never felt this way in my life, i just want to lay in bed all day. i miss school and work; not healthy, totally not like me.	0
155124	i am 69 and have coronary artery disease, and diabetes.....i take 20 meds a day and now i have diverticulitis and have been given cipro and flagyl.....this my 8th day and i have been in bed the whole time just getting up to drink clear liquids...thank god i'm retired because there is no way i could go to work.....the pain before i was diagnosed was the worst....all across my abdomen and down my thighs....i went to er and they did a ct and said they couldn't find any reason for the pain and sent me home with pain meds and said to follow up with my dr....i have two more days to take these meds... hope this is the end.....	1
228304	i love my butrans patch!!! and it has relieved more than half of my pain, and i know this because i only have to take less than half of my pain killers now that i am on the patch! i change my patch every saturday, but if i miss 24 hours my pain starts to reside again. if you are not a heavy drinker i would advise trying this patch!!!	1
178113	this one made me dizzy to the point of being afraid i was going to faint at the slightest turn of the head.	0
192192	well my dr wanted me to try it instead of depo.. but i cramp while not even on my period now and have chest pains about an hour after taking it. i looked up reviews because of the chest pains ... and no surprise others experience chest pain with it. i wouldn't recommend it. also the days of the week label falls off and gets me off track. that doesn't help..	0
133504	i wanted to give birth control a try so my doctor put me on tri sprintec. it started out okay and i was fine with the outcome despite the nausea. however, i then began getting this white milky discharge a week before my period and when i had sex it smelled fishy. i went to the doctor and it was diagnosed as bacterial vaginosis..i have tried many treatments to ward it off nothing worked. i'm getting off birth control and getting my life back!	0
119240	38 years old. i took androgel 5mg /day for 7 months with no, or very few results. i went up to 7,5mg/day for a month with the same effect. the testosterone level is still very low. my doctor asked me to try natesto for a month, we'll see from there !	0
229430	this medication gave me a bad reaction, it gave me restlessness in my legs and suicidal thoughts, i don't recommend this drug for me personally.	0
218058	after taking this for 3 days for a uti infection, my vision was so blurry i could hardly read. i called the doctor and he changed my medication and in a day the blurriness went away. i don't know if the medication works, but it scared me that my vision was going and stopped it right away.	0
124798	i'm so relieved i read all of these reviews. for the past few months after my pharmacy switched me to tri-previfem, i have been so depressed and anxious, crying at random times whether i'm at work or home. i nearly destroyed my relationship and i've had absolutely no desire to do anything i used to love. i'm getting off this immediately.	0
135302	i was prescribed tamiflu tuesday evening, took my first dose shortly after getting home from doc. i ate a small meal as it said to but nonetheless an hour or two later i was throwing up, felt horrible. i stopped taking this medication after the one dose and the next day i felt better. i hate this medication and will not take again.	0
218607	i've been taking tri-sprintec for 6 or 7 months. i started it with hopes of it getting rid of my moderate acne. i rarely got cystic acne, but my face always had zits and i would break out around my period and even worse when i was stressed. now i still have acne, but it isn't nearly as bad as it was before; i also don't notice much of a change in my skin when i get stressed. so it didn't exactly work how i hoped it would, but it is helping some. the first month that i started tri-sprintec was pretty awful. i was nauseous for four weeks straight- from the time i woke up to the time i went to sleep. i've gained a little bit (5lbs) of weight and noticed that my breasts have grown (or are always swollen).	1
159734	i wish i had read about this pill before taking it. i was on minestrin for two years and loved it. cvs switched me to mibelas, and i experienced terrible headaches and extreme shortness of breathe to the point i thought i was going to choke to death. it took me awhile to figure out it was the mibelas, but when i did, i stopped taking it, and i never felt better. i had constant headaches for the 2 months i was taking it, and severe anxiety. i stopped going to class and literally thought i was losing my mind. it is not worth the price difference between minestrin and mibelas. this product should not even be sold.	0
163864	remeron helped my anxiety, but came with side effects. the worst was an uncontrollable appetite and subsequent weight-gain. but everyone is different.	0
121080	had been taking zoloft 50mg about a year, then when my life stress increased, it wasn't helping me cope well. im also taking generic adderal 10mg 2x daily which helps more with mood, focus, and anxiety. since generic effexor is working so well for my daughter, i had asked my psychiatrist if i could try it. from day one it seemed like a miracle and for about half a year i felt pretty normal. doc thought 75mg dose was too low, but once i went up in dose. i started the downward spiral of side effects. on day 3 now, taking zoloft 50mg again, per the doc, but feel horrible, physically and ever so crazy now and then. i'm older female and sure don't need this. wouldn't suggest this med to anyone over 30 because it's so nasty to change from.	0
207055	used it for 2 days: itching, redness that turned to burning rash. suspect it is the glycerin. may be soy derived.	0
53034	i was given this in the er when i went in with nausea/vomiting problems. i've taken a couple of the 4mg tabs since i've been home and they work great. problem is that i only was prescribed 5 tabs and i'm having trouble getting more. i suffer from anxiety and am feeling nauseous on a daily basis. i also think this is pre-menopausal nausea since i've suffered from gastric problems in the past. hoping to get more. don't want to have to take it but i sure want it available to me.	1
109477	i love this implant! 18yo. the nurse completely numbed my arm and i didn't feel anything (i did have a knarley bruise tho.) seems you either love it or hate it when discussing certain birth controls. i have only had one period in 16 month! everyones bodys are soo different and react differentl but i am much happier on this than yaz. good luck ladies on your birth control venture!	1
163490	i have suffered from major treatment-resistant depression for 32 years. i've tried so many medications along with polypharmacy for this, and almost nothing helps. the only antidepressants that are of any use are citalopram, buproprion, and abilify. even this combination doesn't always work--usually the citalopram stops working after a number of months, and i have to switch it out for sertraline. a few years ago, my psychiatrist tried adding 20 mg of methylphenidate twice a day. what a difference! i am now able to get out of bed, work, focus, smile, and have something that approximates a normal life. the only problem with this, is that i am now completely dependent on the methylphenidate in order to function.	1
85244	i've been on this medication for 3 months and i thought my side effects would get better as time went on, when in reality it's only gotten worse. i feel nauseous everyday, i don't ever want to eat, my doctor told me to take it with protein but every time i eat i feel even worse. i've been losing sleep every night from feeling so sick in my stomach, i feel really depressed and my anxiety is through the roof! my follow up appointment is in a few days, i cannot wait to get off of this!	0
8871	after my divorced 1 year ago i just decided to start dating again. i'm 46 in good health. a week ago after a couple of dates with my current girlfriend we decided to take our relationship to the next level. unfortunatelly i couldn't perform as we expected, not able to sustain my erection for her to come. i went to my doctor and he prescribed 4 pills 100mg for 12 usd. i made dry test before, so this wednesday night i took half pill, after one hour i started to fell a little blush. i to test the pill and no much difference so i took the other half, after another 30 min what a difference but next morning big headache. this friday i took half a pill and 500mg paracetamol, wow no headaches, multiorgasmic girlfriend happy.	1
160808	hallucinated, would laugh hysterically for no reason for an hour, then would cry for an hour. this is only after taking one pill.	0
77552	i took cephalexin 500 for ten days following a 5 day stay at my local hospital (with iv antibiotics) for a bladder infection. it did nothing for my infection. but i did get a few nasty side effects. diarrhea, nightmares, and muscle pain. this medication did not work for me.	0
7644	it's amazing how many symptoms come about because of anxiety: chest pain, chest squeezing, dizziness, light-headed feelings, feeling faint, sweating, nausea, heart palpitations. i could go on. xanax is practically a miracle drug. it stops most of these symptoms cold after about 45 minutes of taking it. you feel better, and you look back at one hour ago, and you're bewildered that stress and anxiety caused you to feel so badly.	1
211318	i have been on mybetriq for almost 4 years now, and it has been a life saver. i tried many other overactive bladder drugs on the market with no success. i even had an interstim implant to control my bladder. the mybetriq worked better than anything else and i even had my implant taken out. the mybetriq has everything under control and i am so thankful to have found a drug that finally worked. i have had no side effects that often come with other drugs. my insurance will stop covering mybetriq as of jan. 2017, so i am not sure what i am going to do. mybetriq has been my guardian angel for my bladder - i don't know where i'd be without it.	1
32475	i was on it for 2 years and the quality of my life deteriorated. when i began losing my hair i looked up the side effects of this and i found i must have been one who was very intolerant to it. i had the hacking cough, runny nose, my voice was hoarse, muscle cramps at night, incontinence, lethargy, thin brittle fingernails, and insomnia. i stopped taking it and all those symptoms are gone. i had seen doctors about these symptoms but they dismissed them.	0
183152	my rheumatologist had me on a very high dosage, so much that i had to pay for two seperate scripts at the pharmacy. i guess so many people do have a positive response to this med, my doctor thought increasing the med mg would result in symptom improvement, however that wasn't the case. i hated (that's a strong word for me) cymbalta. i was told i acted like another person while on it and not in a good way. even though i strictly followed my pharmacist and doctors directions when tapering off if this med, i still had severe withdrawal during and after reducing the mg. i even called the doctor and pharmacy because i was so concerned; i all but went to the emergency room in the beginning stages since i had never had withdrawal symptoms before.	0
59010	i have been using depakote for nearly eight years now and has kept my mania episodes under control. the only thing is i have weight gain from using this medication but thats a small price to pay. thank you	1
110391	i gained 20 lbs on nexplanon over the course of a year and a half, gaining 10 of those during the last 3 months while dieting. when i had it taken out i lost 4 lbs during the first week. i stopped gaining weight and after a couple months my body was back to normal and i was able to lose another 6 lbs (so far). not everyone gains weight and i also gained weight very easily during pregnancy. i suspect those two responses may be related. it seems like it would be a great option for lots of people, but beware of this side effect. it's not good for your heart to carry around extra pounds. good luck!	0
187425	my vagina is on fire! i hate this !! don&rsquo;t use !!!! extremely painful !	0
156895	the first few times 5, i used the patch i thought it was a godsend.however,this last time i used it on a 6 hour flight i began to have blurred vision.extreme dry mouth the scariest side effect was hallucinations. i did not know who i was or where i was thank goodness ii was not traveling alone.dangerous. will never use again!!!	0
187777	used periodically when other meds aren't giving relief. makes breathing problems clear, relieves allergic sinus congestion and skin allergy issues dissipate.	1
95656	i have rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, foraminal stenosis, bulging discs, nerve damage in both hands, both knees &quot;going out&quot; and bursitis in both hips and i'm only 28 years old. i have been on lortabs 10/500 and oxycodone 20mg for years, but they never lasted long enough for my chronic pain. so my doctor tried me on ms contin 100mg 2 x daily and then lortab 10/325 for breakthrough pain. wow, what a difference that was, my pain was more under controlled and i was getting more sleep and was able to do some of the things i used to enjoy.	1
218597	i have been taking trisprintec for almost a year now. at first i was perfectly fine with this birth control, but now i suffer from random headaches, my acne is worse, i tend to cry for no reason especially at night before bed, and i'm always in a bad mood. i have noticed withing this past month i don't really enjoy sex anymore, and it's hard for me to get wet, i have developed hypertension, and i missed a pill the other day i was in my 3rd week, and i've missed a pill before and been fine, but when the bleeding first started it lasted 7 days and i wrote it off as an early period because i missed a pill, but 3 days later the bleeding returned and hasn't yet stopped. sunday i start a new bc and hopefully all of these symptoms go away.	0
31993	this was absolutely horrid! i had the yeast infection for one night before i got the monistat. that night i used betadine to relive the pain. it worked! the next morning i got the monistat, determined to get rid of this. night 2: i inserted it and immediately the itching pain was ridiculous. 100 worse than the initial. i tried the cream and nothing helped the burning was on the inside and the cream doesn't go there. i tried by best to lay on my back and take it but the pain was unbearable.after 15 min in i had begun to cry. i couldn't take it any longer i had to try and wash it out. i am so sore and the itching and burning are still there but the betadine is helping. monistat was the worst decision i have ever made.	0
5128	i just recently switched from minastrin fe to orysthia so far the only problem i have had with it is much more acne, the good side to it is that i only get my period for about three days and so far i haven't had any spotting. i'm going to stick it out for a couple of months to see if the whole acne issue goes away.	1
56987	really bad after taste and didn't helped me at all. i'm seeing other options now to help my with the dry mouth.	0
5066	i would not recommend this birth control. i had severe mood swings and was always fatigue. i switched from the patch ortha evra to this pill to get better results and it did not work for me at all!	0
19592	definitely a lot less overall body pain. a little dizzy and sleep but benefits outweigh the side effects.	1
17701	i was on the pill for about 2 years and it became so hard keeping track if i had taken it or not. i had always heard great things about the nuvaring do i decided to try it. my favorite thing is knowing that its just there and i don't have to take it everyday. on the other hand i have broken out what feels like everywhere, i've never had a problem with acne before. also the day after i put it in i started getting really bad headaches and i felt upset. i thought i was just stressed so i kept the ring in. it continued to get worse and it got to the point that if someone even walked by me i would get angry. yes birth control is different for everyone but i took it out two days ago and i already feel so much better!	0
173019	used to take 2 mgs three times per day with my old doctor, stopped for a year, and now i'm on 0.5mg three times a day. i built up a tolerance quickly, but when i have a panic attack 4 mgs stops it dead. i love klonopin, it lasts longer than xanax and doesn't give me a crazy hangover feeling the next day!	1
128049	i started taking this drug prescribed by my doctor on 6/21/16. i had started a diet the previous week of only fruit and vegetables. i dropped a good 8 pounds from that. i started medication and it has helped my appetite control. i took one full pill every day for a week. i started walking a lot. a good 2-3 miles a day. i also kept with eating fruit in morning and low carb/protein during the rest of the day. i have had to drop down to half a pill because of insomnia and have noticed constipation. i am on weight watchers now and follow the plan. i eat fruit and vegetables like crazy and i know it helps the weight loss. i am down 13 pounds as of 7/8/16. i am sure i will start to lose 1-2 pounds a week soon which is the healthy way.	1
10881	first month went well. second month i started bleeding spotting really the second week of active pills. i have now been bleeding for the last month and i'm tired. i've had all the symptoms of a period bloated, headache, tired, back pain,restless at night. i didn't have any of these problems when i was not on birth control. i really hate how this pill has made me feel as well as the all month bleeding.	0
47164	after 25 years of waiting to feel better on levothyroxine i finally found someone to prescribe armour last fall. for the first time in years i feel warm. we just had the worst winter in years and i didn't have to turn the thermostat up once. my bowels are more regular than before. i felt more energy right from the start. more doctors should use this medication.	1
188432	hi! so i'm 26 with 3 kids i had my last baby 3 months ago and i decided to get something that i wouldn't have to worry for a long time. it wasn't painful at all the only time i felt a hard pinch was when the doctor said he would measure my uterus i felt when he inserted the iud but it was not painful at all.. when i went home i felt cramping throughout the day but ibuprofen did the work i haven't had any bleeding at all ...i will update in a few weeks!	1
144609	i had the implanon back in 2010-2013. it was amazing, my period was regular with no crazy side effects. so i was expecting similar results when i got the nexplanon in sept. 2015. i was wrong. sure, i didn't have a period since insertion, but the cost was too damn high! i had great skin, but it broke out like i was back in highschool (i'm 30). i wasn't super skinny before, but i went from 150 to 175 in less than 6 months with no changes to my diet and workout regime. i had crazy depression and couldn't concentrate on work to save my life. i have zero sex drive. i finally figured out that it was the nexplanon after talking about my symptoms with a friend. i got it taken out recently and hopefully things will calm down again.	0
153128	i started taking dox around 2 years ago- i have really oily skin and have regular breakouts around my t-zone. i never thought my acne was that bad until my mum eventually convinced me to book an appointment. i was skeptical at first; the creams didn't work for me and just dried my skin badly, but the thought of taking a tablet freaked me out a little. despite this, i agreed to a 3 month course. by the time the course was finished, my skin was completely clear, i looked like a completely different person! it's important to remember, however, that this medication is incredible, but it does take time! you can't expect your skin to be crystal clear within 3 weeks! there's a reason for the course times, so be patient! good luck!	1
165884	so i had mine put in about a week ago and i had it put in right before i got my other birth control taken out.. the one that looks like a match stick in your arm ( can't spell it right now) and omg did it hurt.. my sister had it and told me it wouldn't hurt but she didn't tell me that it was a lot worse to insert if you haven't had kids - which i haven't.. but it was bearable. we got some ibuprofen and i was fine. i even went shopping after. i still feel like i've got cramps and my back hurts a little more then usual but other then that it's been going pretty great. all though my nipples hurt but i'm not sure what's going on with that.....	1
7478	lost what i typed 3 times in a row!. xanax is awful. completely blacked out, wasted all my fire wood cooking a terrible meal, ended up with food everywhere and half of it missing, and came to several hours later. the rest of these pills are in the bin. worst drug experience of my life	0
10634	i was diagnosed with pcos when i was 17 (i'm 22 now) and my acne had never been very bad until i came down with it. we are talking awful breakouts: face, chest, back... everywhere. my dr. put me on metformin (1000mg) and spironolactone (150mg) and i did get the ib but it wasn't too horrible. i took spiro for 4 yrs up until this past summer when my refills ran out and my doctor told me i needed to find a new primary care doctor so i went a good 6 mo off it. basically my skin has gone back to its original state, i started the spiro again 5 days ago and i am waiting for the initial breakout again but the worst has just been a bunch of little additional blackheads. hopefully i will not get the ib this time! even so, totally worth the results!!	1
61634	i'm on 40mg a day, did take sertraline, mirtazapine now on these, don't think they do anything to me, doctor says he don't know if i got bi polar or schizophrenia lol, that's what u get for being honest. did stop them once for week as thought doing nothing, never felt so ill in my life if that's a cold turkey. i'm 35 anyone else on 40mg?	0
202231	i've been using it for a while and it helps, but it isn't great.	0
107053	the implanon has been great for me. i've had it for an year now and i love it all the way. in the beginning it was adjusting, now i am completely comfortable with it. i still have a period but very few of them and they are light. its convenient and its not even noticeable. sometimes i have to remind myself that i am still on birth control. the implanon helps put me in control of my future.	1
165791	i had sex with my boyfriend on the 25th of february and we found out the condom had broke. i was terrified and was stressing all night. we had sex around 8:30 pm and i stressed all night and finally took the pill 18 hours later. i had light brown discharge 3 days after taking it and i was unsure what that meant. it went away and i was stressing for so long... my period finally came today on march 22. ladies i'm telling you it works, take it within 24 hours and you should be fine! i would've wanted to hear this as i was freaking out!! always make sure you use protection and have a backup!	1
207200	i have had herpes since 10 years old or so. i didnt know then that there was a medicine for this. i have had outbreaks during whole of my life until i was 26 and googled the medicine for herpes. i doctor prescribed me valtrex after this and its the best medicine i have ever taken (accept antibiotics). this was life changing for me and the best option. i don't take it daily though. whenever i feel that an outbreak is coming i take 2x500 mg and the herpes disappears in a few hours. thanking the chemists that found this this. happy new years!	1
212913	i have chronic pelvic pain of unknown origin. this medication reliably relaxes me and knocks me out enough to sleep. it also sedates me enough to have conversations i don't recall and to pass out mid-sentence. needless to add, perhaps, i do not take it during the daytime. like many users, it tends to wear off after about 4 hours and i find an additional dose doesn't promote longer sleep. the sleep i do get is so good that i can put up with the short duration. i am taking the 4mg tablet. a time release formulation would be ideal, i think.	1
57675	i can't take it on an empty stomach. i have to take it every four hours. makes me sleepy. my dentist prescribed this for me yesterday.	1
218841	i have bipolar 1 rapid cycling and life was hell. manic episodes were a little intense but the depression is what really killed me. it got worse and worse over time to the point i felt numb to the world. life sucked and i wanted out. after taking many medications that didn't work (abilify and lithium to name a few) so i ended up in a mental hospital where they finally gave me depakote. it literally saved my life!! i feel normal and stable for the first time in my life and i couldn't be happier. im enjoying every second of my life now. god bless this drug (:	1
12595	just started the medication, &amp; i understand it takes up to 90 days to realize full benefits. however, i've noticed minor improvement in my eyes, without side effects. one big issue: the dose is 1 drop 2x/day. the eye dropper provided is terrible at delivering 1 drop. the stuff goops out, and when i first started, i was probably getting 3-4 drops in my eye. i found the old fashioned nipple glass eye dropper works great at administering 1 drop at a time. however, this means unsealing the plastic containers in which the med is provided. they appear to be sealed, requiring cutting the top off. and, this risks contamination of the medicine. allergin needs to provide a suitable delivery dropper. hence, the 1 star.	0
125374	i took this medicine for constipation relief. it said it would take 6-12 hours to work, but 2 hours after i took it i was in the worst pain of my life, curled in a ball on my bed praying for it to end. after about 30 minutes of intense cramps i started to get diarrhea. for the next 1-2 hours it was a vicious cycle of laying in my bed with severe, debilitating cramps then rushing to the toilet every 15 minutes. ultimately it did what it was supposed to do but i will never take it again, the pain is not worth the result. i'm just fine drinking a couple glasses of prune juice for comfortable results.	0
168627	went in for a routine check up a year ago and told my doctor something has been up and i don't feel right. asa medical student myself, i knew something was up and wasn't going to leave without answers. i explained what was going on and what has been going through my head, and she diagnosed me with depression. i have felt the way i've felt for 11 years because at the young age of 8 i almost lost my dad in a motorcycle accident and the doctors led me to believe i had. i became a recluse... my emotions took over... i got perscribed vilazodone, and took it up until recently and realized it did nothing for me. it was supposed to balance my serotonin levels in my brain that cause depression and anxiety, but it only made me feel worse.	0
155692	oh my! i have experienced bloating, gas and abdominal pain since taking this medicine. the infection does not seem to be clearing up and i only have one day left of a 7 day course of 500mg twice a day. i am tired, have insomnia; and will not take this again. my abdominal pain is extreme! i have been up since 3am and took it this morning; immediately took a bulking laxative after, to put something in my stomach. will see if this helps!	0
203403	i use halcion. it will help for falling a sleep. it works great for me. i don't have the drowzieness when wake up in the morning.	1
139326	excellent product! i actually take it for ms. it is wonderful to have my &quot;want to&quot; back if only temporarily. unfortunately fla blue will not cover for ms so hoarding is my only option. the result are worth it!	1
51509	i have been taking this on a weekly basis for the past 8 months but i noticed that in the last three weeks it's been giving me diarrhea the moment i take it. it just goes right through me. this medication is effective, but you have to make sure your body can handle it. i did, for a while, until recently.	1
122930	this pill makes me taste and smell this nasty sour milk taste all the time. i cannot get rid of it, it makes me so nauseous that the thought of taking it nauseates me already. i get so sick off of it, been on it for over two years and symptoms of nausea never subsided. it has also completely taken away my sex drive, only reason i know this is because once my ex and i broke up i got off of it for four months and i was super horny, so uncontrollably horny, i wanted sex at all hours, but upon going back on it, i have zero desire for it. i've missed many days on this pill, because i rather just not take it, that's how gross it is and sick it makes me feel which obviously reduces its effects. if you can get another, please do.	0
103710	i used ritalin for many years before realizing it had little or no effect on me. i think the placebo effect applied not only to me, but also to my parents and teachers. upon finding out that it's quite common for some patients to have their medication switched 2-3 times before finding one that works, i decided to try adderall (which worked amazingly, but gave me insomnia), concerta (which didn't work on me, since it's basically the same as ritalin), and finally settled on dexedrine, which i don't know how i ever lived without. of all the add medications i tried, it was head and shoulders above the rest as far as effectiveness and had the fewest side effects (which were barely noticeable and disappeared after a couple weeks).	1
5855	i have behcet's, castleman, fibromyalga, osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease. all equals severe pain. i tried everything. i now take opana 30 er 4 times a day and norco 10/325 8 times a day for breakthrough pain. before the opana i wanted to die to get away from the pain. i couldn't play with my 4 kids. all they heard was not right now mommy hurts. now i have my pain under control and i can live my life and play with my kids.	1
125181	this medicine is badl!!!!!!!!!! do not take, worst cramps of my life!	0
160039	i have been taking calan sr 120 for over 10 years now. my episodes of svt occur at most a couple of times a year and then for short duration. my pharmacy issued me a generic once because calan was not available and i had svts almost daily. i was very glad when calan became available again. i would not like to be without it.	1
25033	this injection is only effective if you have mild arthritis. if you have almost no cartilage left it is useless. i wish i had known this before i tried this injection. i have moderate-severe arthritis and got a week or 2 of relief.	0
184934	used it for shoulder/neck strain. broke out in hives	0
33772	i've been on this for 14 days and i feel miserable. placed on it to help regulate my periods and instead i feel like i am on my period 24/7 because of the constant cramping. i was on accutane for a year and it cleared up all my acne. i start this and i start breaking out. i feel sick, my throat hurts and my stomach is aching. i don't want to eat or drink anything. nothing else has changed in my life except for this pill. judging from the reviews, this isn't normal. i'm gonna stop taking this because it honestly sucks.	0
74313	this pill has been awful for me. my doctor prescribed it after my laproscopy and a period of induced menopause due to endometriosis. it has caused major moodiness and i either get my period when it is not supposed to come or don't get it at all. slight weight gain. my breasts hurt all the time, more than ever! i asked my doctor to switch me to something else. he put me on notrel 777- and that is great! hope everybody can find something that works well for their body.	0
141182	i love lexapro. i started taking it when i was 14 from severe anxiety and ocd. my doctor basically begged my parents to put me on medication because i could not leave the house. i'm now 20 years old and about 6 months ago i thought i no longer needed the lexapro because i was feeling better. what a mistake. after the taper my ocd came back just as bad as it was when i was 14. so my pdoc put me on prozac. it made me manic. i then tried brintellix, again it made me crazy. so i went back to the lexapro and yes the start up side effects suck, headache, dizzy (that woosh feeling in you brain), upset stomach and brain fog, and every time i bumped up the dose i had an increase in anxiety, but after 5 weeks i finally have my life back. stick it out!!!!	1
51488	never written a review but this product is sensational. best creme on the market, doesn't irritate skin and very effective for preventing and healing acne. works well on face but even better on chest/back i found. just a few heads up. don't use with any hydrogen peroxide based products(moisturizer creme etc) at this will temporarily turn your skin brown. also don't apply too much at a time as it takes a long time to absorb(it will be visible for a short period). after using accutane i thought that was the only thing that could really help acne but this works almost as well	1
195718	completely changed my life. not a single outbreak while on valtrex. went off it just to see how i would do without &amp; have had 2 very painful outbreaks.	1
3441	within 2 hours of taking the first dose, i had a persistent out of the blue cough and my lungs were feeling heavy and hurting. it was scary. i called the dr. next morning and they switched me to dulfuran i think, i'm picking it up today. i'm not dealing with that crazy cough for a whole week. and these other reviews sound like it would only get even worse.	0
149036	i have had mirena for a little over a month now, and so far its been great! the insertion was very painful... much worse than people said, but this varies between people. i had severe cramps for a few hours after it was inserted, but after that they were mild for the rest of the day (and the next). i spotted for a few days, but that went away and there was nothing until my period. my period was lighter, but it lasted longer. it was basically spotting (slightly heavier than a pantyliner could handle), for seven days. since then, i've had some sporadic light spotting, but its definitely manageable. as for other side effects, i haven't noticed any weight gain, mood swings, or a noticeable increase in acne, and i am prone to breakouts.	1
64233	been on zoloft 50 mg for 3 weeks and i'm starting to feel like myself again. i have mdd, add, anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia but since taking this medication i am sleeping again and waking up without my alarm which has never happened. i was a little sick for the first few days however it passed. my panic attacks are almost gone. my doctor agreed to increase my dosage to 100 mg to see if i can get a little better i'm almost where i want to be but my negative emotions have subsided tremendously. i know this road is hard for all of us but don't give up. remember the chemical make up in your brain changes overtime, so when something stops working seek help. best regards!	1
51679	i took 2 tablets by mouth as prescribed, after eating dinner. after about 10 minutes i started to have very bad stomach pains and felt like i had to vomit. i also felt extremely hot. the effects lasted for a little over 1 hour. although the side effects were bad, i really feel like the meds did the job. it's only been one day and i've have not had any vaginal discharge, and the odor has gone away. to me it was worth the discomfort. hope this helps.	1
22502	excellent - comfortable to use, soothing on use of product, unlike others, as the foam soften and lubricates the insertion, my problems were healed much more quickly using this treatment than any other. if you suffer you know what agony it can be yet this treatment has worked wonders.	1
224098	i had a similar experience. i had persistent back pain that muscle relaxers did nothing for. i started taking bextra and the pain was gone in a day.	1
92289	i suffered with nerve damage at back of my neck. lyrica caused me severe memory loss, confusion and depression. it stopped my nerve problem but my good memory has not returned. i also suffer headaches, which i never had before.	0
81542	i just started this drug 8/21/17, .06 mg. i weighed this morning and was surprised to see i was already down 2.2 lbs. i know this won't be typical, but was concerned when i didn't feel any of the side effects, thinking maybe it wasn't going to work for me. not much appetite, but forcing myself to eat something.	1
27630	works excellent. went on. whale watch with family. took it 1 hour before boat trip and it worked awesome. i even was able to have food on the boat with no nausea.	1
77604	this medication gave me really bad travelling gas with cold sweats and made me very nauseous on the very first pill! i might ask my doctor to replace this medication for something else. i find it very strong, especially for a mild skin infection due to a spider bite!	0
201514	i promised to come back and do a review of the medicine if it had worked for me. about a year ago i had constant panic attacks which eventually became fear to drive, fear to be at a restaurant, waking up and feeling that it would be my last day on this world. doctor said i have anxiety disorder. after trying another medicine with no results started me on 0.5mg sertraline. after a year i can honestly say that i am 98% &quot;panic free&quot;. huge relief within the first couple weeks but give it some time to experience the full medicine effect (couple months). noticeable side effects: sometimes i need to focus on remembering simple things, weight loss (at the beginning) now i'm normal again.	1
40195	this medication killed my father. he took it for 3 weeks having been prescribed this for his first episode of atrial fibrillation. the autopsy results were a definitive cause of death due to lung and liver toxicity caused by the cordarone. do not take this medicine. it will kill you.	0
25491	taking it for three months now hair loss stopped about 90%. yes there are some side effects. morning wood is story of the past. but can get erections not as quick as before but can get easily. ma y be little loss of libido. one thing i noticed is amount of ejaculation has gone down rapidly. my doctor said it will be back to normal if i leave it for 3 months. fingers crossed for that. hopefully it helps.	1
225154	i've been on wellbutrin xl 150mg for 7 weeks now (adult add and comorbid depression). i experienced some of the common side effects such as dry mouth and loss of appetite, but everything came back to normal after a few weeks. sadly, i haven't noticed much change in terms of mood or attention/focus... it hasn't worsened but it hasn't improved either. then again i know this is a low dose. i saw my doctor today and he switched my prescription to wellbutrin xl 300mg. i'm starting tomorrow and i hope it will work better for me. i'm eager to give it another try since i've seen a lot of positive reviews on here :)	0
14848	i've been on this for 14 days and i feel miserable. placed on it to help regulate my periods and instead i feel like i am on my period 24/7 because of the constant cramping. i was on accutane for a year and it cleared up all my acne. i start this and i start breaking out. i feel sick, my throat hurts and my stomach is aching. i don't want to eat or drink anything. nothing else has changed in my life except for this pill. judging from the reviews, this isn't normal. i'm gonna stop taking this because it honestly sucks.	0
10852	the only reason i am prescribed them is to stop my period for several months (i skip the inactive pills and start a new pack). the first month was okay but into week 3 of my second month i started having heavy &quot;spotting&quot;, enough to need a tampon. two weeks later i called my dr to inform them that i had been bleeding for two weeks straight and ask what was going on. they insist that my body is just getting used to the hormones and to keep taking them. it has now been over a month, i'm almost done with my third pack and the bleeding/spotting every day is still an issue. on the rare moments when it's light enough for sex, forget about it. i have no desire and dry as the desert. i'm also extremely tired and have had random breakouts.	0
215713	i got mine inserted 3 weeks ago as i will never take any form of hormones again! i'm 25, no kids and paid $120 extra to get sedated. i think most women don't know this could be an option. after reading many experiences of pain and finding pap smears extremely uncomfortable, i decided to get sedated. best decision! it only took around 20 mins and i had to stay 1 hour after and have someone drive me home. i had mild cramps for 2 hours after and light spotting for a few days. everything is back to normal now so i'm waiting to see how my periods go. i'll check back in..	1
15386	gained 15 lbs in a few months and unable to lose despite exercise and diet...terribly depressed...lots of breakthrough bleeding. been off the pill a week and lost 5 pounds and finally feel normal again. i am mad it took be 6 months to realize this pill was causing so many problems.	0
213714	about 3years ago i used the product and woke up swollen terribly the episiotomy to have my son wasn't swollen like that -i was not looking at the same va jj my bf and i went to the e.r and was asked all kinds of questions. but i never asked the right ones. like what ingredients made me react like that? and what do i take if i ever get a yi again?	0
169558	45 years with psoriasis. tried everything - no luck. on stelara for three years now. wonderful experience. only side effect is i am always tired, but i can live with that as i no longer have any symptoms. wonderful medicine but very expensive. this would be the last medicine i would give up if i had to give up my meds.	1
141089	this medicine absolutely almost ruined my life, to the point i was going to lose everything. it made me nauseous, tired, loss of sex drive , made me want to drink 24/7 all because i didn't care anymore! i lost 2 jobs, because i had no desire to function basically. i have been off it for 2 weeks now now and the side effects from coming off this medication is not bad at all. i feel happy again, a little anxiety but omg i'll deal with it the natural way. ...exercise or just enjoy my family again.	0
226320	i got the nexplanon in june 2014. it works as in i haven't gotten pregnant, but i've had plenty of scares because after over a year my period is still irregular. it started off great, only got it once a month and it was shorter than normal. then at the beginning of this year i started missing 2 months of my period and then on the third month i get it twice as long. i'd like to know if anyone else has had this experience. i guess you should consider my period regular, but it sucks bc i'm in pain for so long (the implant has not reduced my cramp severity). another con is that it itches all the time. but i don't have to get a needle stuck in my butt and i don't have to remember to take a pill everyday and i'm still not pregnant so yaaay.	1
198145	began taking this medication for high blood pressure about a month ago. my daily migraines are gone, readings are back to normal, i have been sleeping great and have no real complaints. i hope there will not be a weight gain can't afford it. the one thing i am noticing is itching around my neck and elbow joints.	1
168771	minimal side effects (nausea for 2-4 days after each titration.) activating, rather than sedating. very effective for depression.	1
73371	i read a few of the reviews on this page and many said that in the first month or so they had terrible acne! this is also true with me but this is the only birth control i've been on where my skin is 100% clear after about month three! i also always suffered from severe mood swings with other birth control- crying over nothing, bouts of rage, extreme insecurity- but this is so much better. the only downside is that for some reason i am very tired especially in the morning- it's almost impossible to wake up even with 8 hrs. but the changes in my mood outweigh the tiredness! great for people who have a lot of bad side effects with other birth controls!	1
44163	i'm 17 and my doctor has given me this birth control twice. my head always hurts, i never feel normal, i'm always sleepy currently about to go to sleep.	0
59887	the first 12 months were great. no noticeable side effects and i didn't get pregnant. then i started having side effects. i couldn't wear contacts anymore, they would literally fall out onto my cheeks. i had them refitted and the problem persisted. at the same time i started experiencing what were likely aura migraines. my forehead, upper lip, and hands would go numb. i would experience large blind spots and large dark moving objects in my vision. these problems happened multiple times a week. i was extremely fatigued and depressed. i stopped using the nuva ring when i realized i didn't have the symptoms on the off week. none of the doctors i saw thought to recommend going off nuva ring. symptom free for 6 months. off nuva ring 6 months.	0
150273	my doctor prescribed zymar for post-op treatment after my lasik procedure. it seems to be working just fine. although, i have no painful symptoms to compare it's effectiveness too. it does cause slightly blurred vision immediately after using it but it only lasts for a few minutes. i have gotten hot-flashes a few times and wonder if this is a side-effect of the drug.	1
230106	i was put on glipizide er after having bad side effects from metformin er. had the diarrhea with it. have had no problems with glipizide.	1
61645	first day 10m i felt euphoria and off. second day i felt intense depression, fell asleep driving at a red light around 3pm. had thoughts of sucide and second thoughts about mental hospitals. my eyes dilated and i was very anxious. no thank you! horrible experience.	0
38426	i had liletta inserted at the end of june 2017. the procedure was quick and i felt only a mild discomfort. i haven't had cramps but for the first 4 months i had continuous bleeding. it has finally subsided a bit but my periods are very irregular. i never know when it's going to start. after sex definitely triggers a flow...which makes me want to not even have sex. also, the worst part is that i am always hungry. i have gained at least 10 pounds. depression has become a concern as well. i really want to have this taken out but i don't know that any other birth control will fare any better as far as side effects.	0
60070	i had a very positive experience with nuvaring. the only birth control that i had zero side effects from, never got pregnant. i stopped using it due to financial reasons and my insurance wouldn't cover it. it was super convenient and i highly recommend it. as far as the horror stories - all birth control methods which involve hormones can have serious serious side effects. it's all about finding what dosage and specific form of the hormone is best for you. any rx carries a risk, all of our bodies are different.	1
118746	i don't normally leave reviews but this page has helped me so much today i feel to share my experiences in the hope that it will help others too. i started taking yasmin 4 months ago and everything was fine for the first 2 packs. periods were very short and light, skin was clear, no problems at all. i'm a first time mum so my stress levels are are always high so when i started feeling bouts of anxiety i thought nothing of it. 2 months on and i feel like i'm a different person, i cry every day, bouts of uncontrollable rage, lethargy, depression - the works! stupidly i didn't put 2 and 2 together until the weight gain began, almost 1kg per month! suffice to say this pill isn't for everybody!	0
120784	keeps my blood pressure down. i have been taking it for 5 months, i now have muscle cramps, and have a problem sleeping. i am going to try a new medicine, i can't take the severe cramping in my body.	1
228945	i took this medication daily for almost a year. it works great and allows for natural sexual intimacy without annoying drug scheduling intake problems. unfortunately, i had to stop taking it due to increasing, debilitating lower back pains - one of the known side effects of this medication.	0
178205	been on this medicine for almost 2 years. went to max dose of 60mg. did nothing for my depression, anxiety, back pain, or fibromyalgia. completely useless medication. and whats worse? you got it- withdrawal. i have been to the er 4 times now since withdrawing from 60mg down to 30mg, so i am only half way weened off as of now. extreme vertigo, nausea, dizziness, brain zaps, edge of panic all day into night. worst experience i have every had after trying different anti-depressants for the last 7 years. gave this medicine the last chance. after i get off it, may take me a year or more to ween the rest of the way down.	0
215786	covered under family pact in california. insertion was painful for a few seconds and cramps for a few minutes then just general tenderness. took about 3 months to fully adjust to it. experienced more hair shedding and painful periods. it failed and i got pregnant! would not recommend!!	0
221963	i've had terrible,recurrent thrush for about a year. my doctor isn't overly intersted,kept just giving me canestan pessaroes and creams. i tried fluconozole but it made my thursh even worse. i'm miserable with it. trying diet,lifestyle and going back to the doctor. here's hoping it clears up. wish the same for everyone else struggling with it too.	0
64804	after living with horrible pms symptoms for over 2 years, a doctor diagnosed me with pmdd. i had 3 weeks of pure hell and 1 week (my period) of feeling semi-normal. the mood swings were so intense, i felt like it wasn't me. i could feel myself getting emotional but i could not stop it. it was like i was outside looking back at myself. extreme highs and extreme lows. i was violent and unstable. after about a month of being on the meds (25mg) i felt more normal than i had in 2 years. they really saved me. 6 months in (1pill a day) i am back to being myself. side effects i have had: decreased sexual desire, dry mouth, some bouts of mild depression, dry mouth, nausea. i'm very happy with the medication.	1
120815	so, i've been battling alcoholism for years - about a decade (and i'm 30). i've been to 2 treatment centers and an outpatient program with the longest stint of sobriety being a solid 109 days. i've gone from being 100% alcohol dependent in my mid 20's to sober to recreational drinking, but almost always i'll end up on benders or sneaking it. anyway, i tried antabuse about 6 months ago and took it for about a month...drank on it repeatedly and got so sick each and every time so i just stopped taking the pills. i'm talking beet red face and neck and chest, heart racing, etc. i'm back on it now. i started yesterday and vowed to take it for 6 months.	1
216752	within 3 days of taking crestor 10 mg i got terrible leg cramps, headaches , nausea and weakness. on top of that i had awful dreams that were scary. within one week i gained 8 pounds. i felt sick. got off of it and just did exercise and watched my diet closely. lost 16 pounds in a month and 3 months later my cholesterol went down from 350 to 169. i feel so much better and all the bad symptoms went away. creator is not for everyone.	0
151617	maybe shouldn't have been writing a review at this point. 1st day taking chantix, took 1st pill about 2 hours ago, no nausea experienced, positive reaction, i hope. praying the rest of the journey is as positive as my first pill. thanks for all the positive input from chantix users, it made my mission to quit smoking even more certain. will keep informed!!!	1
77135	best weight loss medicine ever! 29 pounds in 4 months and 6 pounds more to reach my goal weight. no food cravings and i have cut sugar out of my diet which for me is the key. 5'4 woman currently at 145 pounds. blue cross blue shield covered this medication for me except for the $5.00 co-pay. best wishes to everyone!	1
27572	treated daughter as directed with sklice, and 5 days later, live lice reappeared. disappointed to say the least after washing bedding, putting away stuffed animals, etc. any health care provider i talked to about the re-occurrence said that you must comb out the nits even though the sklice directions and website advertise that no combing is needed. feel greatly misled.	0
113448	i have been constipated for four days and my gp recommended i try dulcolax. i took it at noon and around 6.30pm i was in agony with my stomach churning. i vomited several times and was stuck with unproductive straining. i was having cold sweats and was very spaced out. when i could move to my medicine cabinet i took 10mg of buscopan and some paracetamol which seems to have helped. i am not trying this again.	0
224000	i had to discontinue it after several weeks. it left me feeling tired and weak, and coughing up more mucus. i maybe allergic to something in it.	0
217514	just got my tonsils out and was allergic to the first antibiotic they gave me. if getting this, try the tablet form as the liquid form has a sandy texture and tastes gross! very hard to get down!	1
63237	i wish i would've read this group prior to starting my prep. i've had crohn's disease for 19 years and have had numerous colonoscopies. currently, i'm in good health and my colonoscopy tomorrow (hopefully is just routine. preponik sounded promising. less nasty liquid to drink. hooray. except that i drank magnesium citrate at 7pm last night and preponik at 9am and 4pm with more than the recommended amount of clear fluids and hardly anything has happened. it's now 6:15pm and i just talked to my gi and had to drink an extra bottle of magnesium citrate (a fleet enema doesn't clear our the upper colon). if it doesn't clear out by 2am, i can't do the colonoscopy tomorrow. seriously?!	0
228760	geodon is wonderful for me. for a very long my mind was cluttered with particular obsessions. i couldn't think straight. i've tried luvox, anafranil and a few other augmenters, nothing worked. now, i take a low dose of geodon 40mg a day with 300mg luvox--and have success. it's not a total cure, but, i would say symptoms are 70-80% better.	1
67682	i took plan b within 3 hours of an accident that happened on october 11 2016. i had a 28 day cycle so i was ovulating but i wasn't sure. i waited everyday for my period and took a lot of early pregnancy tests. i found out on october 28 that i was pregnant. this pill doesn't work. in fact i'd get a copper iud put in asap if this has happened. i weigh 205 and 5-6. i ended up with right side pain and went to the hospital for bleeding and fluid because i planned on getting an abortion pill. i was told they had to do a laproscopy and open up my uterus and take the fellopian tube out. my doctor said that the pill is progrestrone only which can cause ectopic pregnancies. i could have died let alone never have kids please don't take this.	0
199298	my doctor recommended this shot to me to help with cramps due to having endometriosis. i have received 2 shots and have been on my period for a total of 5 months now!!!!! the shot helped with pain the first 3 months, and now it doesn't help at all. i will not be going back for another shot. it is awful! i've gained weight, i'm moody, and fatigued. and in case you missed it the first time, i've been bleeding for 5 months! just think of the pads, tampons, laundry, ib profen, chocolate, ice cream, occasional apologies to your boyfriend, and acne you'll get to look forward to... just say no to this joke of a drug!!	0
124006	i've had skyla for 9 months now. (26 no kids). i have a mixed opinion of it. insertion was uncomfortable but not painful. cramps were bad for 30 min/1hour. i menstrated regularly for about 2 months then stopped pretty much altogether (i spot here and there). one major change for me was a huge decrease in libido for the first 4 to 5 months. fortunately it has since gone back to normal. even though i do not menstrate i do often still get the cramps during that time and they can be rough. i do not plan to be on it the full 3 years but it does what i need it to do for now.	1
152071	i am a 25 year old female, smoked for about 7 years up to about a pack a day. i'm nearing the end of my third week on chantix and smoking about one a day. only the physical addiction still tempts me, the actual act of lighting, holding, and inhaling a cigarette. the chemical dependency/cravings are completely gone. if i don't see cigarettes i don't think about them, and haven't bought a pack in over 2 weeks. when i do give in and smoke, the experience is hardly pleasant and i rarely make it through a whole cigarette. i highly recommend this drug if you are serious about quitting and don't intend my list of side effects to deter anyone from trying. restless sleep/vivid dreams, cases of 'the blues', extreme nausea. all very much worth it.	1
57142	well, it works. however, i put it in water once and there was a bad taste and smell to it. maybe i hadn't mixed it well? when i put it in water, it was my first time. i mixed it until it was clear, but oh well. it had a somewhat metallic taste, reminded me of cauliflower. i suggest taking it in like, juice or soda.	1
177230	this drug has changed my life. before taking cymbalta i was depressed, anxious and borderline suicidal. within a few weeks of my first dose (60mg) i noticed that i was more outgoing, friendly and that my mood has significantly improved. although i experience some sexual side effects, the drug has been incredible on the whole. i'd highly recommend it.	1
101347	wow i've been reading these negative comments but i've had a great experience with this pill!! i'm 19 i was on the shot before this it was the worst thing that ever happened to me. but on this one my only side effects were mild headaches and i'm definetly mode emotional. also i sleep a lot more. i haven't gained weight. i don't have spotting. it did clear my acne. my boobs feel bigger. but i also think i haven't had the negative effects because i've been taking these vitamins from super supplements they have folic acid calcium and all the vitamins the lady at planned parenthood said i would need and when i stopped taking the vitamins for 2 weeks i felt real shitty!!	1
156446	i've been on 1 requip for a couple of months with *great* success. last night, however, i got my first breakthrough restless legs syndrome; it lasted all night and was excruciating. i took baths, did some stretching and even took another requip. i got about 4 hours sleep, but rls woke me up again this morning, and it's the same. i've read that many people have had to up the dosage on this medicine, but this happened to me so soon after taking it, i'm sort of nervous. i don't want to increase the dosage already - it's only been a month. thank you for mentioning that some of you have rls breakthrough if you are dehydrated or something else.	1
80635	i was on zovia for 3 months, and had side effects from the start. in the first month, i had a weight gain of 8 pounds. it caused a lot of nausea. it made me severely depressed. i'm switching to nordette. on the positive side, it did regulate my extremely irregular periods.	0
43705	i started taking loseasonique because i live such a busy lifestyle and quite frankly 12 a year just gets in the way! i was very apprehensive to start the pills because of what i've heard about it as far as ongoing spotting that seemingly never ends. however, i went into it with an open mind and expected some spotting. the first two weeks felt like a regular period, and after that, minor spotting not even enough to wear a pad. i would say by the end of the third week, all spotting was gone. i am now towards the end of the 3-month supply and will be refilling this prescription as i could not be more happy with it. i am so glad i made the choice to switch to loseasonique. helps with acne too.	1
162773	prescribes this for a 3 week cough suspected walking pneumonia or bronchitis and cough is calming but 3 days into this and the diarrhea is horrible. feels like i am prepping for a colonoscopy. stomach is constantly gurgling and roiling. deficating while coughing at times. i am calling doc to ask for something else cause i can't leave the house with this diarrhea. need to get on a plane in 6 days. there must be something with less diarrhea side effect	0
18894	while hyzaar did lower my blood pressure to normal levels, i suffered from a respiratory problem typically at night time with a gasping for air reflex several times a night. effective drug but for me, a scary side effect.	0
192519	started yaz a little over a week. i decided to go on for birth control reason, but also to help with what i think to be hormone related acne. i would get a few pimples here and there, sometimes some bad breakouts around my period but nothing too drastic. my skin was clear when i started the pack, but the very next day after taking the first pill i started to breakout. i got large, painful cysts on my left cheek and some smaller pimples on my chin. it started with just one but it seemed as though a new cyst was forming every day. i have been drinking as much water as possible, eating lots of fruits and veggies, no dairy, limited sugar, to try and help with the breakout. so far no improvement.	0
711	i've been on the depo-provera injection since the 1994 inception of off-label use for endometriosis. for the last few years i've started having some side effects over the two - four weeks prior to each injection including severe fatigue and hot flashes. i'll take those side effects any day compared to how i lived when my &quot;endo&quot; ruled my day to day life. i've been pain free for years as a result of the 15 years of depo injections. other side effects? i guess we will see.	1
33350	terrible! never again! i switched to this pill after being in the mini pill because i stopped breastfeeding. this was the worst mistake ever! since being on this pill (for 6 weeks) i've gained 10 lbs, i'm so increadibly moody that i'm constantly fed up with everyone/crying/stressed to the point i can't handle basic every day things without breaking down... my skin looks horrible, i never have acne, and my face, back &amp; chest are covered... i wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy...	0
119353	i was diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism. i am 33 years old and the happy father of two. i started treatment a little over two years ago, once we decided we were no longer going to have children. my initial experience was not good, i went on a rollercoaster of ups and downs and experienced high levels of estrogen conversion from my newly introduced normal levels of testosterone. however, the low t center carefully monitored all my stats, listened closely to my complaints and concerns, and developed a once a week treatment that works. i am now energetic, happy, can think clearly and concisely, have zero moodiness (use to fight with my wife over nothing), and feel normal.	1
51277	i was prescribed this drug three days ago. i have to say, i feel worse than i did when i went in to seek help. it is keeping me from sleeping properly. i have no appetite, i feel like i have the flu when i don't. i have three doses left. i have decided to stop taking it. my head feels buzzy and my ears will not stop ringing. this sucks, all i had was a cold.	0
205114	only side effects i've had is gas, stomach craps, diarrhea but only go to the bathroom once or twice a day. i was diagnosed on june 5 2013 and my viral load was 89,000 and my cd4 258. on july 30 2013 i decided to get checked before starting treatment. my viral load went down on its own to 44,000 and my cd4 down to 248. i was prescribed complera on august 1st 2013 and i've been on it for 3 days. my first lab since complera is sept 1 so i will keep you updated.	1
19884	i have been so ill for days i get sick a lot so i tried to brush it off but it&rsquo;s to the point i was considering going to the hospital. i&rsquo;m vomiting so bad it&rsquo;s painful. i think about recently being prescribed this med and notice that oh it&rsquo;s this damn pill that has me so violently ill. i&rsquo;m still vomiting violently that&rsquo;s not even right. omg someone save me lol also tired achy skin blisters feel off like speedy light headed. def no longer taking them	0

76141	i don't have acne issues, my cycles are the same painful and heavy. but my only issues that i can't deal with are the mood swings, bad dreams and tiredness. i've been taking it for 2 months now and my attitude sucks! i don't even want to do things i enjoy. and there is absolutely no sex drive! i'm glad to see that i'm not the only one having these issues. i was starting to think i was crazy.	0
209222	every prenatal has gotten me so sick i couldn't take, but this prenatal, i don't get sick, no after taste, nothing. the gel like.coating makes it easier to swallow and it's just so simple and easy. no pain, no problem!	1
91662	more like xyrem distress! what an awful medicine. it is expensive and it does not work. don't waste your money. find something else to help you sleep.	0
164050	i've been taking advil (ibuprofen) since 1999 for headaches and body pains. i sometimes take this with the prescription medication maxalt (which treats migraines) i've have really bad headaches and migraines since i was in grade school and took tylenol until when into my late 20's. i then started taking the regular 2 tablet dose, 400 mg. i have on occasion upped the dosage (not on doctors instruction) to 600mg if the 400mg dosage isn't effective and the pain doesn't not subside within 30-45 minutes.	1
11803	shot easy to administer. had nausea come &amp; go - severe at times. expected loss of appetite. shortly after 4th shot, digestion came to a screeching halt. can't eat anything solid for last 2 days &amp; praying the last dose wears off so i can defecate! various anti-constipation treatments have failed. this is the worst medication reaction i've ever experienced &amp; i won't be taking another dose.	0
208669	as a doctor this is the best i've seen tried compared to most other topicals.	1
30819	did i get a bad batch?!? holy moly i'd prefer the general discomfort of a yi to this. i feel like someone sprayed my lady bit with itching powder, doused it with gasoline, and lit it on fire. what is going on?	0
170443	turned me into a dribbling zombie. everyone thought i was drunk. horrible.	0
1431	this drug is the only thing (apart from being knocked out)that works. yes, the injections are expensive but what a life saver, never leave home without them!	1
169860	i was in a car accident and have chronic pain. amitriptyline takes the edge off. the side effects are dry mouth, confusion, dizziness, nausea and chronic lethargy to name a few. the one that put me off completely is risk of liver damage. my feet have been swelling for 3 weeks. for the last week my calves have been swelling as well.	0
31668	i started my first one last night. let me just say i'm running on two red bulls and three cups of coffee because i got literally no sleep last night. the burning and itching was so intense i considered many times to run to the emergency room. i'm very scared and don't think i'll continue the treatment.	0
50350	i have been suffering from restless legs syndrome for several years, sometimes very pronounced and frustrating. i recently had major surgery and, for reasons unknown to me, the doctor's prescribed gabapentin for me (3 x 300mg caps daily). since taking them my rls has totally disappeared. that's right, totally. nada, nunca, none. i has been two weeks now and i can only pray that this continues.	1
9947	first off, let me start by saying that i am sensitive to hormones. i cant seem to find one that doesnt make me sick, or extremely moody. i was put on this for endometriosis pain, and the first day i took it, ate with it and was fine. the second ay i took it, i also ate with it, about 8pm, i went to bed at midnight and woke up at 4 am sick to my stomach, shaking and my heart racing, just like i have before with another pill and was vomiting for about 2 hours. i am now, 2 days later, bleeding and my period wasnt suppose to be here until 2 weeks from now !!! . it doesnt feel like a period, but its not fun either. wouldnt reccomend for anyone who is hormone sensitive,.	0
18250	i had a free sample from my doctor. i was so happy when i first got it. i thought i couldn't feel it, my vagina was swelling inside after 2 days. i am a clean person, i did not even have sex right after i got it. my boyfriend said he felt the ring was uncomfortable while we have sex. i could barely enjoy sex because it burned. i have problem peeing since it burns and i could feel the ring was so irritating inside me. my mood was swinging and i had so much attitude ever since i had the ring. it was worse than having pms. i lost interest in sex. other than being happy for not having to deal with birth control every day, i would not recommend it if you are sensitive like me.	0
51112	took two 500mg (1,000 total) in one dose. a little stomach pain but was able to sleep it off. no other side effects. the key to taking this antibiotic is to eat eat eat. eat something before and eat something after. and drink an entire bottle of water and then some. you'll be fine! most people only share negative reviews but my experience with the antibiotic was just fine. and i have the worst anxiety. just eat and drink water, and you'll be fine.	1
154254	i've had gerd since i was 14 and i had tried all sorts of otc and prescription medicines. most of them worked ok, but i would still have to pop a few tums before i went to bed. after starting on nexium i feel great! i've yet to have any signs of heartburn and i haven't had any side effects. this is the most expensive prescription i've had but the cost is well worth it.	1
124892	i have only been in this birth control for almost a month. immediately after the first few pills my breasts began to get very tender and they have definitely grown a bit. i'm having terrible stomach pains, bloating, nausea, i'm constantly sad. my acne got worse, but i haven't gained any weight. i've been spotting for about 2 days now, but i'm not supposed to starty period until next friday. hopefully all is well, and it's just my body getting used to the hormones. however, if these symptoms do not clear up within the next month, i'm going to try to switch or just stay off of the pill. i'm going insane due to the fact that i feel like i'm pregnant, but i'm hoping it's just the birth control side effects.	0
200913	26 when diagnosed, 3 ablation, at least 50 cardioversions open heart cox maiden success. at 37 went on tikosyn. i live a normal life in sinus rhythm 99 percent of the time. if i had to do all over i would not have had any surgery. however a very nice effect of the cox maize is that it nearly eliminated my risk of stroke. been on tikosyn for five years with no noticeable side effects.	1
50987	omg never again. within 30 min of taking the 2 pills for the first dose, i experienced a feeling of being intoxicated. it is now 12 hrs later. i still feel high or intoxicated like i had a couple of heavy drinks in me. i'm stumbling, cannot operate a vehicle, walk, or even take a shower or stare at this screen or type on my phone. this drug is horrible. i am jittery and i feel like i'm dying so bad that i just had to call an on-call dr to prescribe me some augmentin, which i know i can tolerate. i'm taking panic attacks and i feel i am in a brain fog and &quot;comfortably numb&quot;. cannot concentrate or think on this drug. its the same feeling like right after a percocet, but the high feeling hasn't let up. i hope this feeling goes away soon!!	0
130274	the condom broke on saturday night and we didn't realize it until much later that night. i was completely freaking out so i made him go buy me the plan b pill. i took the pill around 13 hours after sex. i don't think i've ever been that scared in my entire life. (way too young to have a child) after taking this pill, i got sharp stomach pains. and 3 hours after i took it i experienced sore breasts that were so sore that i couldn't ever wear a t-shirt. this pain lasted for 3-4 days. the days went on and my period tracker (if you don't have one i suggest you download one) indicated that i was 3 days late for my period. i finally got it and i've never been so happy! so glad i took this pill. i recommend this pill.	1
5171	i've been on orsythia for a year and half and i've had a regular cycle twice! i get it early and it lasts 7-12 days, and it's just brown, not a true 'period'. recently i've started to get the bad acne everyone mentions. i'm 43 and have pimples on my chin and forehead (never had it before). it has eliminated my breast tenderness and cramping though - that's why i strayed on it. but it's just too unpredictable and so i changed to another birth control. i do not recommend it.	0
86043	this pill has done nothing for me, it has only dragged out my periods. i got on this to shorten them and it has definitely not done that. it has made me way more emotional and every little thing gets on my nerves. i am switching.	0
182584	the price keeps going up and up while the yen is getting weaker. $100 retail increase in the last year alone. no suitable generics. over $700 retail for 90 days this year. $600 last year. these appear to be fake prices. canadian prices are significantly less, but... insurance monthly charge went up as well as the amount they would cover went down. insurance doesn't have in formulary, and alternatives are &quot;deadly&quot;.	1
188687	quick and painless procedure. i've had 2 kids and breastfeeding my 4 month old. no complications so far. it did start my period which lasted 4 days with mild to moderate, pretty normal, bleeding. the cramping i experienced the day of the implant procedure was mild and made better by tylenol. i love my paragard!	1
127085	i was given this in iv before surgey. i immediately became anxious and could not sit still . the pa said &quot;oh yes this happens sometimes&quot;. they had to give me benadryl to calm me down. it was the worst experience i have had -out of control and jumpy.	0
204411	if i could rate a 0 i would. while i was on it for only 4 weeks i became extremely irritable and was constantly hating myself. worst meds i've ever been on and i've tried a lot.	0
4342	i had a muscular injury to my leg. i rubbed on the ointment and the &quot;slight burning&quot; the packaging warn of was a horrible burning that i could not remove with repeated washing with soap and water. the intense burning sensation went on for a few hours.	0
98796	i've been taking this birth control since march of 2017 and it's worked great for me so far. no pregnancies, no side affects. i absolutely love it. i still get my period during the placebo week but my cramps are way more manageable, and my period is super light and only last 2-3 days, when before it was 4-5 days and horrible horrible cramps. i've always had clear skin but i do notice that the first two weeks of a new pack, my skin is glowing! towards the last week of the active pills i get my regular period about to start pimples. sometimes i notice a slight increased irritability but i can't completely attribute that to just this birth control. i've had horrible mood swings on a past medication and haven't gotten even an ounce of that.	1
188712	i am 23 and have had paragard in for 6 months. i got it because i was going to be working abroad without access to daily bc options. the insertion was almost painless, just a pinch feeling. about an hour after i began to feel cramps and some pain. the next day it was mild and then gone by night time. my first period was way heavier than i was used to! i also had terrible cramps and pains. i wanted to get paragard removed but i couldn't since i was abroad. the next few periods were also painfully crampy with heavy bleeding but i noticed the pain decreased with each period. now i have had seven periods and it is back to normal with just very minor cramps. the bleeding is not as heavy either. i am happy i never had it removed!	1
157230	my mother has been taking it for one month and her dementia - which was mild - has gotten worse. she is confused and thinks that my brother lives with her. she was taking samples as she cannot afford the medicine	0
16278	so, i had been experiencing irregular and painful periods due to low body fat and my lifestyle (i am an avid runner). my doctor said i was suffering from amenorrhea. so he placed me on minastrin. literally within a week and 5 days of taking the medicine, i broke out in severe hives on my legs and arms which were red and itchy. i called my doctor and told him and he suggested that i take benadryl for the allergic reaction. the benadryl did not help. i also was experiencing mood changes where i would either be down in the dumps or angry at the world. i was then instructed to stop taking it and begin a new one. one day after not taking the medicine, i started bleeding heavily and having severe cramps. 1st time i ever had bc.	0
32268	been taking lisiniprol for 7 years with great results. the side effects have been minor with nauseous. and dry cough. until now i have been coughing every day with a spell of that nauseating. feeling everyday that is is time to change drug after reading everyone is having similar side effects.	0
21007	got severe gastrointestinal pain/cramps and diarrhea after 2 doses.	0
24556	this was much easier than expected. first i went on low fiber diet two days before taking it. one day (from mednight ) before procedure i went on clear liquid diet with no solid food. then took gl at about 6 pm. no reaction until seventh 8 ounce glass of gl. then it did the job it's designed to do. no pains or cramps. the solution was cold and i got each glass down as fast as comfortably possible. taste? i didn't notice anything bad about it and did not add any flavoring. it's like drinking a lot of water. maybe they should have a beer flavor to make it go down even easier.	1
6643	i have been taking this medication for 30 years, and have never had a side effect or seizure. works very well for me. no complaints.	1
229455	i started on 20 mg of latuda. i now take 80 mg at night after supper. i also take pristiq and lorazapam. i have been good for five years on it. no bad side effects. i do go to bed and take the meds at the same every day.	1
15112	my pharmscist auto refilled to this generic version. i was spotting in between periods and an emotional mess. this is one of the worst bcp's!	0
201159	this is about my woman who is on zoloft...... two years with my woman we never needed any lube. now i'm worried she is like a desert. calmer now that her little zoloft friends in &quot;her head&quot; tell her to stay calm it's ok. i'll keep you up to date with her &quot;progress&quot; with her voices	0
41795	i just started on clonidine. i was noticing tiredness and insomnia and i am emotional as well. my hot flashes are definitely less often however i am unsure if i will keep taking it due to the waking at night with the flashes which have not changed unfortunately. i will see how it goes for another few days.	1
199454	i switched from a hormonal contraceptive to depo provera january of 2013, never had any problems (weight gain, acne, irregular bleeding) for the first year and a half and only bled about a week or two before my next shot was due. starting about 8 months ago i was bleeding almost 2 months before every shot and the last shot i received in march i continued to bleed 2 weeks after getting the shot. i also noticed an increase in extreme depression and anxiety. i have also spent the last 6 months dealing with breakouts (which i never had before) and an increase in keratosis pillars on my face (not sure if its related to a hormone imbalance). i would never recommend this shot to anyone.	0
72735	as soon as i started this birth control i became very nauseous and bloated. i also became extremely hormonal and began flirting with every guy i saw. i got a lot of side effects as well: stinging eyes, extra sensitive skin, mood swings, soreness, etc. as far as periods go..this still gave me a period and i ended up having brown spotting (gross), back pain, and cramps. it also lasted longer than my regular one usually would. this bc pill will not help with your acne as it tends to give you more hormones than less. i know you've probably heard that your dermatologist say you should give a pill 3 months but in my experience it should start working immediately. just my advice:)	0
640	it started off great, for the first month. but then by the second month, my period became a monster. it lasted for so long and started on a very random day that wasn't even close to my regular period cycle date. also, i'm on an emotional roller coaster ride and almost constantly angry at something or someone. i don't like this at all.	0
110700	i have been on duragesic 75mg for about 5 months now and it has helped more than all the other pain killers i have been on. i have had three major back surgery's plus ddd and osteoporosis. the only thing is make sure you have water proof tape around because they sometimes become loose and fall off and you don't want that.	1
108280	this is truly a mind altering drug. takes the lust with food out of your mind. i had difficulty the first two days i went from 3/day to four..so i backed off to 3 again for another week and then did fine when i increased. i do have headaches, but i have never had the nausea ppl talk about except for the day i increased to 4. i have asthma and hypertension. both are doing well on this drug. i have lost 11.9 lbs in 5 weeks. i do not feel deprived. i still enjoy an occasional sweet treat, and have still lost weight on those days. the main thing that i have eliminated is snacking. i really don't have any desire to do that. i drink a lot more water now too. this drug does seems to give a dry mouth. very happy with this drug.	1
218832	depakote was started three months ago when we exhausted all efforts with every other preventive med for migraines and headaches . i have been experiencing these my entire life. since 6 years old . now 35., imitrex was used to try to knock off the migraine but insurance only provides nine pills a month so i found myself breaking them just to get through a day .and if over used they will no longer work. so i'm adding in aspirin all that junk. ending up in er. just to go back the next two days because the stubborn migraine would come back , or laying in bed holding my head with ice. needless to say , on a small dose 250 a day . wow few headaches a week i can deal with. weight gain well now i can workout no real excuse there.	1
22239	i used axiron at first and noticed an improvement but nothing explosive. i think the absorption was decreased as you put in your armpits and then have to put deodorant. t levels did not really go up. switched to testim and i have really noticed a huge difference. more energy, improved muscular definition (which was decreasing before treatment even though i am always active), sharper, much improved sex drive and mood swings are gone. have not yet done a t level test with testim, but i expect higher levels. i recommend that you really apply the gel on both shoulders (half tube on each) and rub it into the skin. this sure helps alleviate the stickiness to your shirts. the smell can be bothersome but what is the alternative? low t?	1
207224	valtrex has been a lifesaver for me. i've had this virus for 12 years now and would suffer through monthly outbreaks that lasted almost until the next outbreak would occur. i started by taking 2 500 mg pills/day or 3 pills if i had an outbreak. now i take 1 500 mg pill once every second day and have had only one very minor outbreak in the last 2 years. if i feel an outbreak coming on i up my dosage to 3 pills a day and the outbreak is stopped/prevented. valtrex is worth the cost, it makes living with this condition manageable. in addition to valtrex, i avoid what i've found to be triggers for me...my only regret is not starting on this medication sooner.	1
20833	i was concerned because when i take this medicine i have the most bizarre dreams. i mean they are really out there and the funny thing is i remember them, and and go back if i think about them and continue the dream. to me this would be ok if the dreams were pleasant but they are not always.	1
152356	i have had multiple kidney infection and urinary tract infections and nothing works better or quicker than cipro. i also take cranberry pills along with antibiotic and this seems to help me flush my system as well as lots of water and cranberry juice. i find that i don't get relief for a couple of days (2-3). i do have one side effect and that is my joints hurt, but it disappears after the 3rd day of use (for me). also, i wouldn't take on an empty stomach because it can and will make you nauseous. otherwise, i would recommend for both urinary, bladder and kidney infections.	1
66539	it cleared my skull based osteomyelitis fast.	1
231657	i have been struggling with depression and anxiety for about as long as i can remember (i am 21). since i was sexually molested 3 years ago, it continued to get worse, anxiety attacks, major depression and horrible insomnia. if i ever did get any sleep, it wasn't until after 5 am, and very minimal regarding hours i would sleep. i was sent to a behavioral hospital after a recent suicide attempt, and they prescribed me trazodone 100 mg, along with lexapro 5 mg. within 30 minutes, i go straight to sleep. i will warn you though, within the first couple weeks, i would wake up groggy and feel confused throughout the day. after that, and the medication set in, i sleep better, feel energized, and i feel better.	1
231110	i'm on day 6 and i already feel the difference. yes, i felt some of the chills, mild fever and dizziness. i figured i continue to see how it went. so far so good. i was in pain for the past year and i was just diagnosed this month. my pain is not completely gone, but i can honestly tell you that i feel about 80% better. which is better than i've felt in a long time. i pray that it continues. my side effects are almost completely gone.	1
176166	i am a 35 year old female with bipolar disorder type 1 and generalised anxiety. i've been taking lorezapam off and on for about seven years, only during panic attacks or particularly bad spells when my anxiety can't be managed by the coping techniques i've learned over the years through cbt, mindfulness meditation, etc, and my daily mental health medications (quetiapine, venlafaxine, and topiramate). when i do need to use it lorezapam is a godsend. it works more quickly than diazepam, which i'd previously tried, which is what you want when you're in the midst of a panic attack or suffering badly with anxiety. it's very effective without being too much and i haven't had any side effects, just slight sedation.	1
40635	terrible. developed rash all over within minutes of drinking a cup of readi-cat 2. test was postponed and i was sent home. it took hours for the rash to clear. thanks to a nurse who noticed the rash and stopped the procedure.	0
102541	i was given this medicine by a regular medical doctor in tandem with prozac and ambien. what a horrible combo!!!! after being on abilify for several weeks every nerve ending in my body felt like they were on fire. i was hyper and couldn't stay seated. i found out that this medicine was burning my brain and causing akathisia. i called my doctor and told him what was going on and he wanted to double the milligram. i said....ohhhhhhhh no your not!!!!! because of this medicine combo things got so bad i tried suicide back in february of 2015. i took 13 sleeping pills. the hospital doctor in the psych ward said the combination i was on was wrong and he was surprised i wasn't in the hospital earlier !!!	0
130924	i didn't rate the mirena higher just because i haven't had it that long yet. i read so many horror stories about the pain and what not before i had mine inserted. it totally freaked me out! well, i am 25 years old, have never had a kid, and it was not that bad. my doctor was talking me through everything while she was putting it in. all i felt was a little pinch followed by what felt like a pretty moderate menstrual cramp. i simply concentrated on my breathing, and i was fine. i got a little flushed, and i was a tad bit lightheaded, but it was nothing. so far, so good. i've had a little cramping off and on and some spotting, but that's it. best of luck if you decide to get it.	1
161324	definitely does its job. light and manageable periods that last 5-6 days. skin has never been so clear. about 4 pounds of weight gain which is no problem. but, i am moody. i have always been a happy person and this pill causes you to snap easily and cry easily. still rating a 10 because it does its job and other than mood swings i have no complaints	1
117955	did not help much with my crohn's, but less side effects than others.	0
204319	i had high hopes that this would help my anxiety but it seems like it made my anxiety a lot worse. i now experience bad nausea and trembling which didn't happen before. i also had low appetite and more severe anxiety attacks. i took 15mg twice a day for six weeks. thankfully it doesn't have withdrawal effects but unfortunately it didn't work for me.	0
82874	i've been on paxil for 16 yrs and overall it's been a positive in my life. there have been days through the years when anxiety has still arisen. this spring depression returned and my dr increased my dosage from 20-30 mg. after a month my mood stabilized, depression lifted and i've been able to resume enjoying life again. however, last night i drank 3 beers and today have walked around like a zombie. not worth the after effects!!	1
30767	39 weeks ... had a bv infection which caused this full blown yeast infection. my due date is in 2 days. mucus plug just came out before inserting monistat 3. the discomfort is intense. burning vag, still itchy.	0
232190	not diabetic neuropathy, but neuropathic pain nonetheless. works wonderfully... ...except for the terrible acne it's causing, and the relatively frequent but terrible headaches. i also have some issues with anxiety; it has done exactly nothing of use there.	1
27145	after three treatments of otc failures i used sklice. i got a special brush from beauty supply store used for coloring hair, $1.29 and separated hair like a beautician does to apply product to small areas from scalp to ends. started at the base of neck and moved upwards to top and front of head. took me over 2 hours to apply. then put a shower cap on for 45 minutes. used nit comb to comb out the same way i applied. i found adults &amp; tons of nits. kept cleaning nit comb with baby wipes in ziplock bag for safe disposal. total success. after days i keep searching her hair and finding nothing. my cost was initially $351.52 minus online coupon and my insurance resulted in a final out of pocket expense of $10.00. great product.	1
137909	i've been on boniva for 5 years, and my bone density has not improved at all. i don't know if it would have been worse without it, but my scores have not improved. and now i'm beginning to read that you shouldn't be on boniva for more than 5 years.	0
11772	i have taken trulicity for four weeks now. at first had bad side affects. headache, nausea, diarrhea with terrible cramping. but each week it lessened. now into fifth week. doing much better. still have no real appetite, have to remind myself to eat. but my blood sugars are down! that was my main objective. haven't lost any weight, though. but still glad that i hung in there and got through the adjustment period.	1
62870	i have been taking generic cozaar for about 3 months. taking 25mg one time a day along with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. it mildly lowers my bp. i get readings near 120/80, but also get high readings some time as well. dr wants to up dosage to 50mg per day. i want to wait a while as my bp isn't that bad yet and i am trying to slowly adjust to the side effects. i am constantly &quot;dry&quot; and thirsty for water. i have bad dizziness that gets really bad on occasion. the side effects are much less to me than lisinopril which had me coughing 24/7 and gave me bad angioedema after 3 months.	1
176180	you would have to be crazy to take ativan. i took 1-2 mg 2x a day for 6 months and had withdrawal symptoms for almost 4 years after stopping over a 2 week period per my doctor. if you think your life is bad before taking ativan just wait until you experience the withdrawal and after effects of this poison. after 2 years still had vibrating hyper sensitive vision and hearing . burning in your nerves especially in your feet. forget sleep all you do is lie in bed awake for me almost 2 years dreaming while awake. that part was the most torturous part of the med. the fda needs to remove ativan from fda approval immediately.	0
171807	i was having severe leg pain which i am not sure what it was caused by but i do have fibromyalgia. i took the mobic and within about 2 hours, the pain was drastically reduced.	1
167493	i developed pretty aggressive bleeding due to fibroids, got to the stage where i needed a blood transfusion. the doctors mucked around for a week, suggesting ablation, hysterectomy, etc. finally, against my better judgement, i agreed to a mirena. i expected things to take some time to settle, and they did, however three months on things were looking good. then out of nowhere the bleeding started to come back, not like before, but with lots of pain and constipation. i'm six months in and its like my uterus is fighting to bleed again. its like a war. it hurts. apparently a woman with fibroids should not use a mireena. if i take it out, its hysterectomy time. if i leave it in, its god knows what...	0
169061	great improvement over other ssris. visual problems are very limited. penile anesthesia is absent, muscle rigidity found with other ssris are gone (i work out a lot and feel tense all the time). more in terms with reality. much less drowsiness, fatigue is present, very diminished libido to a point i have to remind myself to get some every now and then. more sex friendly than zoloft, although zoloft in small dosage gives better penile vasodilatation and therefore, better sex. overall, i wished this medicine was available 6 months earlier, i would still be married today.	1
120888	i&rsquo;m 25 and have newly diagnosed fibromyalgia and depression diagnosed from a very young age (about 6 y.o) i have always felt a stabbing, &ldquo;zinging&rdquo; radiating / pulsating pain in more than 8 parts of my body. i know that with depression and anxiety (which i also have) it comes with the crappiness of muscle pains, general malaise and weakness. due to kind of &ldquo;holding myself together&rdquo; (mentally and physically) on a daily basis , i&rsquo;ve developed poor posture. daily habits of clenching my body or hunching to dull certain pains and finding ways to sit that are moderately comfortable, have made me feel like a prisoner in my own body. after a week on these meds, i wake up feeling rested and alive! my body works how it should and the pains are gone!	1
225931	i had tried zoloft in the past, went off because i was feeling better. many years later, needed something again. went back on zoloft - it did nothing. tried it in combo with wellbutrin - nothing. tried just the wellbutrin - nothing... except a 25 pound weight gain. everyone says you lose weight on wellbutrin... uh.. not so much! i gained 25 lbs in spite of barely eating and taking up running...and.. it made me sweat all the time. it did nothing for my mood, but the side effects were completely depressing. p.s. the weight did not come off after i quit taking it. my guess is it damaged my already slow metabolism.	0
33573	this is my first time taking birth control pills and i have only been on this pill for almost a week but i already feel like i am going to love it. my mood has improved and my appetite is also suppressed. i have already lost a few pounds. one negative side effect is that i have been spotting since day 1 but its manageable and they say this goes away after your body adjusts to the hormones.	1
74353	i am new to loestrin and so far i am satisfied. the main reason why i started birth control was because of painful menstrual cycles. i have only been on loestrin for 2 weeks, but so far so good. i was hoping for a little help with increasing the size of my breasts, but so far nothing. hopefully this works for me and for everybody that is taking loestrin!	1
65230	i have taken bp medications for 10 years. i decided it was time to get my act together. i changed to a healthy lifestyle. i eat healthy, exercise and lost 120 lbs. my old bp medication worked great, but due to my lifestyle change, it got to the point where it needed to be adjusted due to low bp. my dr put me on this and it has wrecked me. i have chest pains, nausea, cold feet and hands, and lethargy. i thought i was dying.	0
89136	it really works for my son as prevention for asthma attacks	1
118435	age 60 male. several years with bph being managed by xatral but turp coming soon. past year my depression/ptsd being managed by cipralex 20mg. unhappy with weight gain and anorgasmia so i was just prescribed fetzima. weaned off the cipralex and yesterday was the first day of introduction of fetzima (20mg) but within hours i developed urinary urgency and much reduced flow. discomfort increased through the day causing pain and extreme gas/stomach bloating. so 24 hours later i'm not taking fetzima again until i talk to the doctor. it may just be coincidental but i fear the side effect of urinary retention is a real problem with the fetzima when exacerbated by a pre-existing bph condition so beware!	0
137966	i've been on the patch for over a year and i love it. i had a bad experience with the nexplanon and breakthrough bleeding. i don't have that issue with the patch. i do not have extreme mood swings or weight gain either. the only downside to it is that i get nauseous for a day or two on the 1st week after the no patch week.	1
211315	i've been taking it regularly for about a week it was very helpful at first and sleep well. now i'm is so much pain in the bladder and right kidney mostly in my back. i'm starting to really worry. my blood pressure is really high and i'm having blurring vision. thank god i'm seeing my doctor tomorrow. that's if i don't have to go to the hospital	0
174306	worst birth control ever! i had been on ortho tri cyclen lo for over a year or 2 and my insurance had just chose the tri lo sprintec for the generic brand. the pharmacist told me it was the exact same thing. no it wasnt. i felt fine my first pack and the right into my second pack i started to get anxiety attacks out of nowhere. i would just be sitting on my couch and my heart would start racing and it felt like i couldnt breath. i was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis 3 years ago and it completely made that flare up. on top of all that i was upset all of the time for no reason. i would not recommend this birth control to anyone.	0
173373	it does what it says, so 3 stars. if you like orange oil coming out your butt, missing work, and fryer grease farts, then you'll like alli. i'm thinking, if you don't have a lot of fat in your food, then it might be tolerable, but i'm not willing to find out.	0
138740	i have been on adipex for one week. i wanted to use it as an appetite suppressant while i changed my eating habits. i have used adipex and the free i phone app my fitness pal to track everything i eat and drink each day right down to vitamins and excercise. i have lost 7.5 lbs this week. no soda, no side effects. hungry by dinner, but full quickly. i'm only looking to lose 40-46 lbs and i am well on my way! i suggest you only use this pill as an appetite supressant while you change your diet and excersise. if you continue your same patterns, this drug will only be a temporary fix.	1
29581	i have been taking topamax for mood disorder for the past six months along with my antidepressant and anxiety meds and i thinks it's great! it's improved my mood so much with no side effect. i recommend it to anyone.	1
141544	when i first started this on 10mg, i had bad sides. insomnia, crawling skin, heart palpitations and shallow breathing. i think a lot of it was in my head and from reading too much about side effects. my doctor wanted me to go back on celexa but i had already been on lexapro 3.5 weeks so i asked my doc if i could stick with it. he bumped my dose up to 15mg and its now been 2 weeks on 15 mg and it has helped alot with my anxiety and panic attacks. i can now actually function at work. give it a chance. i'm no doctor but for me it took over 4 weeks. it worked! hang in there.	1
96458	this is making me vomit, giving me migraines, making me more irritable and i have dizziness.	0
146511	didn't work for me &amp; bad side effects after cyberknife. no libido and painful or no ejaculation at all. stopped &amp; was ok. 16 months later developed a uti bph &amp; bladder issues.urgent urination day &amp; night started coming back about 8 weeks ago and dr put me on cialis 5 mg samples daily (insurance would not cover) for bph &amp; 500 mg of cypro for uti was ok then 1 week ago conditions worsened after running out of cialis for just a few days &amp; started remaining flomax again for 4 -5 days and went down hill really fast. i am now urinating 20 + times if not more.i cant leave house literally. can hit in 3 seconds my urine culture just came back negative and on 500 mg of cefuroxime. started back on cialis yesterday brutal waiting for doc to call	0
216318	i'm 47 and in good health except for a heart condition i've taken 20mg, 50mg &amp; 100mg tablets and they all produced outstanding results. i like to take them on an empty stomach and most of the time they're working within 20 minutes. all information about the drug says that it lasts for about 4 hours but for some fortunate reason they produce solid erections all day long and well into the next day. 50mg seems to be the sweet spot for me if i want all day and next day action.	1
16940	i am a 24 year old female diagnosed in my 20's with adult adhd. i spent my entire childhood unable to focus on tasks, finish anything i started, behave and sit still in the classrooms. i scraped by barely with c's and d's in grade school. eventually focusing became so hard to do with people around that i had my parents homeschool me. fast forward to now, i am currently in my first semester of college, and i have a 4.0 gpa. this medicine works wonders. i normally cannot function at all. i am disorganized, and always have racing thoughts. on procentra i am calm, focused, and organized. i finish tasks, and manage my time better. i take 10mg. a day, oral solution. this medication is also covered on my insurance, with only a $10 co-pay. love it!	1
71269	i have just started my 2nd month of 7 days of injections. i have had no adverse reactions, except the injection sights get very red and later peel. my white blood cells went down and then started back up. my platelets and hemoglobin are quite low but so far no blood transfusions. i am told each time they will make white blood cells go lower.	0
14795	i went on this for my intense period cramps. when i first started it, i immediately started spotting-which is a common side effect. however the flow was heavy, i had severe cramps that made me feel nauseous and i was super moody. i was easily irritated which got me into a few heated arguments. however, i barely felt any cramps and flow was light. no sign of weight gain nor acne changes either. the next few months, it felt like i wasn&rsquo;t even on the pill, since my period cramps returned, my face broke out with more pimples, my appetite grew, and i was bloated all the time. the spotting with cramps returned and when i contacted my doctor, she gave me the option to try it for one more month. but i had enough and i switched brands.	0
181121	this really burns!!! honestly, no joke. like someone is pouring fire directly into the cornea. couldn't drive a car till my vision returned, which is not great when on the way to work. yeah, it gets the redness out, but not before you experience pain similar to having your eyelids tattooed with rusty nails.	0
115832	i have been on depakote er for 4 months. my dosage is 1500mg a day. i went untreated for many years (18yrs) because i didn't have health care and failure to accept something was wrong even though i was a lot off the wall. after 3 weeks of depakote my moods were pretty even and stable. i also felt a little numb, i missed my highs, but it was better than being psychotic one minute and crying in another. but at the 4 month mark my hair has started falling out in clumps, that was my only side effect. so i'm now transitioning to lithium. fingers crossed.	1
15469	i was on gildess and it was good for the most part (experienced extremely large breasts and they are already too big to begin with!) and then the pharmacy switched to blisovi and it made everything worse!! even larger breasts, extreme tenderness, and so much cramping and pain! seriously, it's like i'm not even on a pill when aunt flo comes around. i can't wait to switch this pill!! but it does prevent pregnancy (i'm hoping) so i'm giving it 3 stars.	0
25455	very good medicine with in 4 months of taking this drug my hair fall almost stopped completely. my hairs are now really thick, decent hair regrowth in crown area.	1
142894	had it put in right after giving birth first five months while i was exclusively breastfeeding were ok i would get a period that was longer than usual with spotting between then the last 3 months when my baby started solids and as my hormones changed it became awful i was heavy bleeding for nearly three months straight - blood clots and all. in the end i was so drained from it i had to get it removed	0
120652	finally, one doctor diagnosed me with irritable bowel syndrome and prescribed me bentyl (dicyclomine) 10mg. now when i have an attack i take one of these and within 30 minutes and a heating pad on my stomach, the pain goes from a 10 down to about a 1. the only downside is that it makes me feel stoned and high like a smoked about 5 joints, i feel very confused and very tired. but all in all it works very good for the pain	1
73207	i have been on this pill for about a year, after switching from one that made me very very moody. i have noticed a much lower sex drive, but it does its job so i'm not complaining. my period is always on time, i hardly ever spot between them an i am overall very pleased!	1
63986	i started zoloft after being on citalopram. citalopram worked the best for me but due to my age, my gp wouldn't raise the dose after 25mg stopped helping. i've been on zoloft since around february or so and it's increased my anxiety dramatically. to the point that i can't sleep and i'm writing this at 4:49am. i also noticed i started to struggle with death anxiety a lot which i hadn't had problems with in the past. i am still taking zoloft but will hopefully be changing medication in the next few weeks.	0
92973	have been on several antidepressants and this one seemed to be the first to work well. only side effect was nausea but only lasted a week or two.	1
148614	i decided to have mirena after being on the pill for so long. the insertion was painful but barable. my doctor said because i have had no kids my cervix has never been diallated so it could be painful. she made sure i took ibprophine before the appointment. i'm prone to migraines around my menstral cycle and i noticed they were gone. a def plus for me! but a major down fall was major hair loss and major acne on face, chest, and back. i have scars everywhere. i'm a hairdresser and spent a ton of money on acne and hair stuff, nothing worked. i never had any other problems or had any other symptoms. i would still have it in if it wasn't for the hair loss and acne in my mid 30s. everyone is different and has their own experiences.	1
179525	the doctor prescibed epiduo as a 27 yr old i have never suffered from acne and it has just come out of no where in the past couple of months. after reading reviews i cannot believe how i have the same experience using this as a lot of people! yes it gets rid of the spots but.. at first it was fine slight burning after the 4th day of using it (only once at night) my skin was worse than acne! i have never been in so much pain on my face! red! itching rash! i am stopping from using this now as it feels like someone has scrapped the skin off of my face ! the doctors should warn us about this before prescribing!!!	0
129527	me and my boyfriend were having sex and the condom broke inside but we didn't notice so when he pulled out, we were scared and so we went to krogers 15 mins later and took the plan b pill. so exactly one week later i got my regular period . so this stuff works. i didn't think it was gonna work but it did... but i took another one the day after too. i don't think i'm supposed to do that .	1
14870	i was put on this bc by an army provider because i have severe ovarian cysts and the worst periods. i took it for about 5 months. the only side effects i've had are some mood swings and i literally cried about everything. i got off it for a while; because of training reasons and i'm just starting it again. i'm two weeks into my first pack and i'm still loving it! less side effects than last time, give this birth control a chance!	1
1611	i wish there was a way to give this a negative number. i've had ibs for 14 years since having my gall bladder removed. i took the initial dose of this and not two hours later i was doubled over with severe pain right beneath my ribs. when the muscle spasms started, i went to the er. i was admitted with pancreatitis and liver enzymes 10x normal. i spent 4 days in the hospital until my numbers were back to normal. i could not believe a pill could do this much damage in such a short time. very scary!	0
115568	did not even notice initial administration of this drug. woke up feeling perfectly fine.	1
139708	i tried this and wanted it to work. it made my stomach hurt so bad, it made me forget all other pain.	0
33766	it's effective - i have yet to become pregnant, however, i've had the worst breakthrough bleeding and weight gain. going back to loestrin. my primary doctor changed my prescription without my knowledge and my ogyn just told me. i would not recommended junel to my worst enemy.	0
25666	my dr told me to take this to ease premenstrual syndrome - one week before my period - the second time i used it i felt very strange - i couldn't stop crying i called my dr and broke down in her office. before this i had not spoken more then a few sentences to her, she got upset with me and told me to see a shrink who put me on prozac 3 weeks of use and i had a manic episode and was informed i had become chemically bi polar and that ssris can cause this to happen. it took 2 years to feel ok again	0
92450	my experience on zofran has been alright so far. i suffer from pcos, endometriosis, and gerd. all three of those combined make my nausea outrageous. sometimes to the point where i have to call in to school or work. i had an er visit a week ago because my pcos pain meds made me severely constipated. they gave me zofran in my iv along with 6 other things and 2 liters of this water stuff. i've been taking it for a week now and it's alright. it works fast but it doesn't make my nausea go away. it does ease it to the point i don't want to throw up everywhere though. overall it's a pretty good med. they've had me on 6-7 other meds to prevent my nausea and i have to say this works the best	1
81546	i just started saxenda and have only taken 4 of the .06 doses. i have already lost 5 pounds. i am about 5'3&quot; and started right at 200lbs. now 195lbs. seems promising, so far. not really any side effects. i've had a little bit of stomach pain, but it was brief. no nausea or vomiting. my doc did say that the weight usually melts off of people, so we will see! i took phentermine a few times. the first time i lost 15 lbs in a month, but it made my heart rate faster and it gave me very bad anxiety. i'm glad there's another option that doesn't have the bad side effects. i do know that the cost is astronomical for saxenda, so my doc is giving me samples for now. my private insurance doesn't cover it at all.	1
165681	i realize everyone is different but i don't think the insertion could be that bad for anyone especially if you take a little something. the day i was scheduled to have it inserted i fell and hurt my foot quite bad (found out later it was fractured) i decided to go to the appointment anyway so she could check my foot. anyway i was up on that table, hurt foot in a sling and still had her insert this iud just to get it done. it was not that bad and has been amazing at making my period just a trickle now but lasts over a week very slow but no other issues.	1
93352	i have been on brintellix for 5 weeks. i am feeling more and more like my regular self. my primary issue is gad. i am finding that i am able to focus and concentrate better, my thoughts are not as obsessive, my motivation is increasing. my psych said that i need to give it another few weeks for maximum efficacy. i just hope things keep improving. primary side effect at start up was nausea. but it went away after a few days.	1
152011	i have been taking chantix for nearly 3 weeks. i have almost all of the symptoms mentioned by other users and was really surprised to hear people talk about lower back pain, which i have as well and did not realize it could be from the medicine. while the nausea is subsiding, i too, am angry and agitated most of the time. i also am experiencing episodes of severe depression. i suffered a major heart attack last october and was a two pack a day smoker. i was having success using an e cigarette but when i had problems with them, i returned to smoking. i am still smoking after with the chantix but hope i will be able to stop soon.	0
127009	i started this medication for gastroparesis after 11 months of not being able to keep anything down. i noticed it helping after first two doses. i was so excited until the awful side effects started. drowsiness to the point i couldn't function, severe stomach and back pain and bowel issues. i had to stop after 5 days in order to be able to take care of my family. so disappointed.	0
170892	seroquel xr is very good. it boost up my energy. after trying other medications this is the best with little side effects. in the morning you feel like staying in bed and weight gain because of hunger craving.	1
3207	i was diagnosed with a bladder infection and had been given the script for macrobid. right after taking the first pill i had the worst headache that nothing would help. i did take a 2nd pill and that about put me down with the headache. i took advil, tylenol. i ended up taking a tramadol which helped a little. i felt very weak, out of sorts, nausea, no appetite, gassy stomach and my neck hurt like crazy. over all i felt like i had a real bad case of the flu. i also want to mention that i had extreme anxiety. i am already ocd and this medication magnified everything. i would rather suffer from the bladder infection than go through this again. i thought bactrim was bad. the only thing macrobid helped with was my low grade fever.	0
104174	i have been on this pill for over 2 years now and i love it. my breasts have grown, and the only downside is that i get a little acne when i am on my period.	1
67230	i love this stuff. ended my reflux and perpetual sore throat. i was thankful for how quickly it worked. now to the packaging! these pills are nearly inaccessible in the packaging they come in. i use a scissor to open the pockets where the pills are incased and then store the pills in a small bottle.	1
24868	been on avodart for 3 months now. 0.5mg a day. don't have to urinate as often. have regrown almost a full head of hair. libido and ejaculation are still in working order. although i take an aromatose inhibitor to help combat having low dht and high estrogen. for those who have libido issues this may be the culprit as dht is known to help regulate estrogen in men. having little dht will result in an increase of estrogen and low sex drive.	1
139649	i was prescribed this drug for ocd, depression, and anxiety. i couldn't take it for longer than 2 days. it did not help me with anxiety or depression only made it worse. if you take this drug and it makes you feel awful you're not the only one.	0
122601	i have been taking linzess for the past 2 months. i love it!! i do not suffer from ibs or constipation anymore. i take as directed and works perfectly. i must note that i have to take hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure. the linzess did not work when i took the diuretic. i drank and drank water and all it did was make me pee. i have noticed less bloating and water retension since i took the linzess. i try not to take the diuretic unless i need it. the linzess has given me a better quality of life!! love it!!!	1
73903	the first few weeks on the pill i found an increase in breast size as well as an increased sex drive. however after two months of being on the pill, my breasts shrunk back to their normal size, my sex drive was completely gone, and my face broke out in horrendous acne. i have white heads and dark spots everywhere and my skin really hurts. i have also become more depressed and during the times of pms i have experienced severe thoughts of suicide. it has definitely affected my everyday life. i was on the pill for about five months. this is not the pill for me and i have just switched to apri. best of luck and i hope this has been helpful.	0
175993	i was prescribed levaquin for a sinus infection-on the up-side, the sinus infection is gone. but after taking the second dose, i started itching all over esp. my face	0
54985	i have been taking contrave for 4 days. i am 5'2 1/2 and wgt 156. i was taking phentermine but then i began to read about contrave and asked my dr. for it. i have been taking it only four days i don't feel anything. does this medicine have to be taken for a while before it kicks in. i take one in the am. i don't have any of the symptoms that i read about. i not sure about the cravings or eating to much because i feel like it may be a placebo effect. did anyone else have this kind of feeling.? should i just give it more time to kick in.? its not an inexpensive drug to keep taking if it doesn't work. i hope i am wrong and the weight loss will start happening soon as it did for some of the people i have read about.	0
47077	i have hashimotos thyroiditis. united health care &amp; medicare says armour thyroid is not covered by them. i was on armour thyroid for 15years. my insurance made me try other meds.i tried other thyroid meds including nature throid. i put on 48 lbs under nature throid my body was tired i was dizzy &amp; could not function &amp; had incontinence. i now am back on armour thyroid feeling better everyday &amp; decreasing in weight &amp; other symptoms are gone. but have to pay for it myself &amp; since i am on social security it is a big expense. thanks armour thyroid	1
18888	i have used hyzaar for 8 months. it does cause strange heartbeats and even much discomfort in right part of my chest about an hour after taking the pill. i never had any of that before.	0
115824	into the third week became very depressed. i was so tired all i wanted to do was sleep. than my lower back became so painful i could hardly sit down. i also was getting the twitches and all my joints ached.	0
25719	well basically when i first used it, it was great only have tender breasts felt a little sick but it went away. then all of a sudden i had these terrible mood swings. felt really emotional. and i've been that exhausted, i've had to take naps during the day. so yeah not that good for me.	0
88129	this medicine gave me the worst heartburn. i have never had heartburn before and this hurts! my whole chest is burning and gurgling and doing all sorts of crazy things.	0
54108	i had to quit ritalin, despite starting on a very small dose, because it gave me tremors and a &quot;wired&quot; (but not alert) feeling. the problems did not diminish within 2 weeks, and that was all i could stand.	0
186390	i'm 23 years old and i've been suffering from on again off again moderate depression since i was about 18 years old. i am considering pristiq and this is why. my father, a great guy who suffered through depression since he was about my age, has been on pristiq for the past couple of years and i have to say, it's made huge improvements in his mood. he has shown no visible &quot;to me at least&quot; side effects. he used to be cranky, unhappy, and just overall openly expressed severe dislike for the world and the human race. since he's been on pristiq though he has done a complete 180 he no longer hates everything so much, and is very fun to be around, he is almost always in a good mood and enjoys spending time with his family.	1
113170	the expierence was awful, but the reviews here seem to be inaccurate. first, you feel as if gas is stuck inside of you. second, comes a wave of nausea. third, you're on the toilet for almost an hour and a half and in extreme pain. the pain isn't er worthy at all. advil helped me. once you go #2 and everything flushes your system you're left with diarrhea and the cramps right before going to the restroom. the pain for me was on my sides and abdomen. also, the pain was on my back and my hips. i took three. do not take 2-3 pills. take only one. one has the desired effects without the majority of the pain. i hope this helped	0
44478	i took this pill for several months and finally got a hold of my doctor's office to switch to something different. i had been on ortho tri cyclen-lo and had no issues, but had to switch to something less expensive. although my breasts grew about half way into my cycle, they were so sensitive i could hardly stand it. i had horrible mood swings and would just feel like i could break down crying at any particular moment. good at pregnancy prevention, but not sure all the nasty side effects that come along with it make it worth it.	0
182779	my personal advice to anyone thinking of starting cymbalta, don't do it. i only wish someone told me before i took it. granted, it did take the edge off of some of my pain short term. the side effects just aren't worth it. i was fortunate enough to only suffer mood swings, anger, brain zaps and so on for about a month because i wasn't on it that long. they don't tell you that once you start taking cymbalta, it's near impossible for someone to safely come off on their own if they have been on it more than a couple of months. just please do your research. some people have had great success but others barely lived to tell their horror stories and others aren't here	0
170012	this drug is surprisingly risky to take. while it certainly does have a significant effect in terms of reducing tension, anxiety and overthinking and sleep problems, it certainly has some really unpleasant side-effects. for instance it&rsquo;s extremely sedating, it shuts down the emotional system making it almost impossible to feel any feelings except extreme tiredness and irritability. not the type of drug i&rsquo;d recommend anybody, but definitely the drug i&rsquo;d warn people against taking.	0
142038	my mom died when i was 4 and last semester i always had anxiety in the background and now at 15, spring semester of '08 i had some mild panic attacks and worry, nervousness, sadness and excessive shyness all day long. this medication is a life saver and i love it. they say 8 weeks for the full effect and sure it might re-balance your chemicals in 8 weeks, but give it a chance as it still takes a while after that for you to break out of your shell.	1
130758	i got mirena over a year ago, and for the first year it was great, but then i started to lose my sex drive. i didn't even suspect the mirena, then a few months ago i started having my period every other week, constant heartburn and nausea every morning, my breast became sore. i honestly thought i was pregnant but 5 tests said otherwise. i'm going to my ob/gyn friday to get it removed and hopefully everything will improve.	0
144757	hi had mine removed after 18 months. although it is effective the side affects are awful. extreme fatigue!! was the worst, instantly felt myself again after having it removed. put on weight but only because i had no energy. i got really bad deep spots something which i had never suffered from before, some which left scars on my face. i also bled randomly, although it very light it was most days. i had bled for 3 weeks straight when i had it out. i'd never use it again.	0
68830	so i've had two shots so far my period has been heavy when i get it and i spot all month long. i've experienced depression in the past and it seems like it's gotten worse on the shot. i've actually attempted suicide since i've started the shot.my sex drive is crap and my mood swings are crazy. i don't recommend this shot to anyone	0
213592	this time it was worse with red painful tender labia, intense itching and a small amount of discharge. that gave me the green light to go to urgent care and get the pill. but i didn't want to wait at the doctors office and waste away the day. i googled monistat and this one had the best reviews (in stars) i waited until it was time to go to bed so that i would be laying flat. i checked reviews again to see how long the healing would take and i see reports of burning. i freaked and waited for the agony. but it never happened. no burning. no pain at all. i felt better the next day! i think maybe some women had really bad cases that caused the burning. it worked great for me!	1
54773	took my first dose today and within an hour i was sicker than i have ever been. terrible headache, nausea, flushing of skin. i have never had an issue with my blood pressure but an hour after the dose my blood pressure was 192/92. scared me to death. fortunately within the hour it was close to normal. i ended up in bed all day because the symptoms i was experiencing were so heinous and lasted for over 7 hours. i could not open my eyes due to the least bit of light was excruciating. i have never experienced a migraine before. also, i had previously taken wellbutrin (zyban) to quit smoking 12 years ago and never had any side effects so i had very high hopes for contrave. also, i am not on any other prescription meds.	0
49724	as for using this drug for muscle pain i found it to be useless i took 4800 mg's a day four 800mg tabs twice daily found no difference in pain just got a painful burning rash on my back neck stomach and arms bad choice as a pain killer just a ftug a dr prescribed because he don't want the fda looking at his prescription pads	0
148678	to be honest i don't know there so much negativity about the mirena. i am 23 years old and went from the depo to the mirena. yes there is pain at the time of the insertion but not something that advil cant take care of. after the insertion i drove to work and took an advil and worked for the rest of the day. the insertion was about a month ago and the bleeding is so light its noticeable only if i wipe. don't make any decision based on what you read because it is not as bad as everyone here makes it.	1
219404	my son just started this 2.5 weeks ago. he is 9 with adhd and odd. the medication works fine for symptoms. yet i'm concerned because he has developed a tic where he constantly taps his legs and sometimes hits them with his fists pretty hard and twitches his eyes. we are going back to the doctor for management.	0
141713	took about a month to work and has helped immensely.	1
231572	i am very sensitive to drugs. so i was put on 25 megs of trazadone. it worked for about a week then i got very sensitive to it and it knocked me out. my eyes and nose hurt and i was very tired. so i had to go off it. i ended up in a crisis center until things settled down. this drug did not do good for me.	0
25578	i have arthritis and not much cartilage left in my knee. i have had only one injection and have been in bed in so much pain that i'm crying for two days!	0
68506	okay i&rsquo;m on this medicine right now and i am a older teenager and i don&rsquo;t recommend it! i mean yes i can have sex but still i&rsquo;ve been gaining so much weight that i have to starve myself!! i&rsquo;m always so moody and i never want to do anything. i get very depressed especially at night and i cry so hard until my throat is raw! i don&rsquo;t mind being able to have sex without worries but it&rsquo;s not worth all this that i&rsquo;m going through! i honestly miss my period i feel so unhealthy without it.	0
118970	i have been using zoloft to treat mainly social anxiety for about 2 1/2 months now. i started off taking the lowest dosage- 25mg. two weeks later, my psychiatrist doubled it to 50 mg, and four weeks later, he doubled it again to 100 mg, which is where i am at now. the first few days of starting it i felt absolutely miserable, and for those with severe depression, it may very well be debilitating. but i stuck through it! over time, and still continuing, my moods have become remarkably stable and positive. my insecurities and obsessive negative thoughts, especially ones of a jealous nature, have nearly vanished. sometimes it's harder to orgasm now, but my libido is still intact. zoloft also helped me with me with my vaginismus and irritable bowel syndrome.	1
199982	horrible! i have been a smoker for 14 years. i tried chantix and the dreams are so bad i didn't sleep but a hour or so a day for 21 days before going crazy from sleep deprivation. i attempted to harm myself multiple times, lost my job &amp; boyfriend, i had to send my kids off because i feared what i might do. i trusted nobody cause i feared they were all out to get me. i couldn't breathe, my whole left side went numb for a week...this medication ruined my life and i'm still a smoker (which i feel safer doing)	0
101371	i'm absolutely done taking this horrible birth control! i've been taking aubra for a month and a half... i'm moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it's stubborn. cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, chin and neck. after doing some research online, i discovered i'm not the only one. birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... i will not be taking this any longer. it also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, i wouldn't know. i started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven't had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though!	0
192896	i have been taking yaz for about a year now. my skin cleared, my periods have always been light, my cramps are normal, or easier to deal with. however, i cannot gain weight, and my breast's grew about a cup size. i know these things don't sound like a bad experience, and i am not saying i dislike this contraceptive, but obviously, not being able to weigh more then 115lbs isn't exactly normal. i also just don't really have much of an appetite. i am especially hungry in the morning. i occasionally get tension headaches, however, not sure if that has any relation to this.	1
60643	i normally had really good blood pressure. 1 week before starting claravis my bottom number was 66, 1 week after taking claravis my bottom blood pressure reading was 98. you are considered to have high blood pressure at 90. i can't believe it got so high so quick! i'm stopping taking it today! not worth the risk of having a stroke. also really expensive medication.	0
231214	one 5ml dose of hydromet had me nauseous and vomiting for around 8 hours. it killed my cough while also killing me. the end.	0
932	extreme fatigue pressure in my head headaches dry mouth	0
113158	dulcolax pink-save yourselves &amp; don't take it! 10 hours after taking it i began to get some stomach cramps &amp; gas. 12 hours in, i finally had a bowel movement. just a few minutes later, i had another, but this was diarrhea. after that it was like spewing liquid hot lava out of my bottom every hour or so for 10 hours. i lost count but this stuff wreaking havoc on my poor bottom happened at least 12 times. the stomach cramping was the most intense i've ever experienced. each time i sat on the toilet i thought i was going to throw up &amp; felt faint &amp; was drenched in sweat. i legitimately thought i might have to go to the er but no way i could drive-i considered calling 911 for an ambulance, but waited it out instead. worst experience ever.	0
226359	i've had this birth control for about 5 months now i have gained weight, also have bad temper, mood swings ,always tired, headaches, depression but no period. i want to get removed at same time i don't because worried about another pregnancy.	0
107692	i have had the implanon since october 2009 and since then i have gained 50 pounds. i was 189 and have gotten up to 232 pounds. far as the pregnancy thing goes i will give it a 10 because i didn't get pregnant. i would not recommend this method if you are borderline obese because you will more than likely gain weight.	0
96274	i was switched from lexapro to zoloft 50mg about a week ago and i found it quite helpful for calming my mind from obsessive thoughts and depressed feeling. now i am on 75 mg and it is further improving my condition. after 1 week, i will be on 100 mg and i am hoping that it will give me more good results.	1
187624	i have severe pollen allergies and allegra d was the best medicine i ever took, until i could not sleep. it causes insomnia in me so the trade off is insomnia versus feeling miserable 24/7. it took 2-3 days before i first received relief. then there was a huge difference.	1
32994	i used this b.c pill for month and suffered from a lot of side effect. being extremely emotional and cry for no reason. heavy bloated and abdominal pain that i couldn't realized if that is a symptom of endo or what? headaches, difficulty sleeping at night, shortness of breath i stopped after a month and most of symptoms are gone never going back on this pill again. now i'm using visanne just for 3 month as per my gp to see if endo is shrinking. much better choice so far.	0
52873	i had a migraine for 7 days. when i finally couldn't take the pain anymore, i went to my doctor and was prescribed this medication. within 20 minutes my migraine was gone. its heaven sent. you have to take it as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. also it makes me very sleepy. but almost all medications do that to me. if you haven't taken it ...get it. it will solve your migraine problems.	1
29409	i've struggled with my weight for years so my doctor started me on a combination drug of the topiramate/phentermine (low dose) she said the success rate is awesome. there is a &quot;diet&quot; pill out there with both combined but she said it's usually not covered by insurance and very expensive. advised from a pharmacist to have my doctor create the same thing which is 2 scripts the topiramate and low dose of phentermine. i just started so i'm on day 2 and it cost me 30.00. i've not had any cravings, have had to remind myself to eat. i'll keep you posted as things move along. best of luck to you all on your journey.	1
140784	i started getting anxiety my first year of college. i had previously had mild anxiety, but it was not as debilitating. i was constantly worrying what others thought about me and had obsessive thoughts. i started on 10mg of lexapro and it completely changed my outlook on life. i did not realize how fun life could be before i lived it without the looming cloud of anxiety. it also helped tremendously with anxiety surrounding the intrusive thoughts. some things that worsened my anxiety while on lexapro were birth control pills (hormone imbalance worsens anxiety) and hard alcohol. i take 1/2 tsp inositol powder (a type of vitamin) and probiotics that seem to help my anxiety and depression in addition to the lexapro.	1
1791	i have been taking zomjg for migraine for the past 10 years, i used to suffer for 2 to 3 days with migraine. i was prescribed a lot of different medications, with no success. the first time i took zomig, it took my migraine away within 30 to 45 minutes. it has just about always taken all my headaches away from then on. usually one 2.5 dose tablet takes it away. on occasion, i have to take a second dose. it has improved my quality of life greatly. i rarely have side effects also.	1
168413	worst ever. this cream makes it feel worse. this company seriously needs to do something. hello...	0
200263	i took champix for the first time approx 4 yrs ago and had absolutely no side effects that i can remember, despite people telling me that when they tried it they could not cope with the nausea, so they couldn't continue with it. i was smoke free for just over 3 yrs. i thought it a miracle esp as i had been smoking 25/30 a day for 44 yrs, ever increasing in amount since age 16(5/10 a day). however, i started smoking again, slowly at first thinking &quot;well one or two with alcohol and friends won't hurt&quot;. sure enough i was hooked again. now having taken it for 2nd time, 12 days into champix, i am tired,have dreadful indigestion constantly, tog with flatulence, headaches, and shaky. actually threw up yesterday. will persevere cos i know it works.	1
98919	i love this birth control! i was on lo(lo) and i gained 25 pounds in 3 months. then i gained 20 pounds on this b.c. but i always got my period clear skin everything is all good but i can't lose the weight! i'm 5'6 i used to weigh 145-150 now i'm 198-200 due to this b.c. my doc is now giving me to try yaz very scared i don't know if i rather be fat or get a blood clot.	1
189154	my sig other was being given roxy 30s daily by his friend and partner at work. his wife and he were both prescribed 180 a mo. at first my man was flying he worked 8-18hrs a day on call for weeks at a time on top of his 40-60hr schedule. it was insane. then his friend started smoking them and didn't have the extras very much anymore. this is where hell came into our life. my man was addicted no script. he was miserable sick and in fear of the awful sickness that loomed constantly. he was mean. they both deteriated and lost their jobs eventually. it ripped our family apart. when my guy was let go he payday loans so deep they took his entire paycheck. his friend died on his bathroom floor last year. our family was torn apart.	1
168051	this medication saved my life! i've only been taking it for almost 2 weeks but i was thrilled at the fast response i had to it! i've literally tried almost every other antidepressant without much success for over 20 years - for my debilitating panic disorder/gad/depression. thank you to the dr who started me on this recently while i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. i can now leave my home without any fear or anxiety; my panic attacks/panic are literally gone! i feel like a new person! the only side effects i've had so far are dry mouth/dry eyes and a bit of tachycardia. it also helps me sleep for once; i take it at bedtime. i was titrated up to the 100mg dose once at bedtime. i cannot emphasize enough how happy i am to have this!	1
138329	i was on tamixifen for 5 years- it drove me into severe depression-i was delusional to the point of being in a psychiatric hospital for 1 year-no doctor at the time could find out why i was as i was! i had water retention-weight gain of 25 kilos, fluid on my lungs-which caused coughing to the point i felt i was suffocating-insomnia, joint pain, nausea and hot flushes and to crown it all skin disorders of which the rash and sores made me look like i had hiv. bicarbonate of soda and lemons and ginger have improved my health!	0
197076	i had a rough childhood. growing up, i tried to stay positive and press on. as an adult anxiety became overwhelming to the point where everything started to stress me out. this happen ed to me around 29 and i dealt with it until 31. i had been grinding my teeth and clenching my jaws as a reaction to stress, causing damage to my teeth...about $7,000 worth. my dentist said i had to do something about stress if i wanted to have any teeth left in my mouth. i saw a dr and was diagnosed with anxiety, ocd &amp; ptsd. ive taken paxil for almost 2 weeks and am relieved of anxiety but feel pretty spaced out and numb right now. motivation is lacking as well and im nautious on and off. im hoping these side effects subside	1
81529	if you have a teenage daughter with acne, this is the answer. it was amazing. my daughter went from having inflamed acne all over her forehead to perfectly clear skin. it worked gradually and she does not take the placebo. acne was gone in a few months. she also feels perfectly fine otherwise.	1
91467	i have been on arimidex for 4 years 4 months. i have had the hot flashes, vision issues, bone density weakening, joint pain and stiffness, depression, mood changes, insomnia, back and bone pain, thinning nails (of already thin nails), weakness in hands and now, my hair in breaking off and drying out. my doctor wants me to hold on to the end of the 5 years. not sure i can.	0
200440	chantix worked for me although the side effects were no fun for me. i was a pack day smoker for 9 years. chantix took my cravings and desire to smoke. experienced vivid dreams, stomach pains, dry mouth and extreme hunger. i stopped taking it after two weeks. for about a month after taking it, i experienced severe depression. i had forgotten that was a symptom so i could not recognize what had caused this until my depression was over. i have never struggled with depression and this took a toll in my work and the way i related with people around me. i started smoking again a month later. planning on giving it one more chance and this time, ill be able to recognize it. good luck everyone.	1
200424	3 1/2 years ago i decided to take chantix to quit smoking. for me chantix was a miracle. i have had no desire to smoke since i quit. i feel so much better and breath much better. i smoked a pack per day for over 20 years. i was feeling short of breath and exhausted all of the time. not any more. thank you chantix.	1
83651	best inhalant i've taken, all was fine until my teeth started to fall apart, and in a short time 4 molars are gone and i need implants and another medicine i guess, i want the teeth i still have to stay, if they will. if they go too i will return to anoro ellipta, what do i have to lose then?	1
134652	was getting severe migraines. tried aspirin and motrin. both didn't work at all. i needed something stronger. my doctor then prescribed sprix nasal spray. she told me to spray to the outer part of my nostrils and to only breathe through my mouth (do not breathe through nose or sniff otherwise you will feel a burning sensation like others i've read on here). i did exactly on how she instructed and amazingly the migraine was gone in 5 minutes. and there was no burning sensation at all. i love sprix. it's now my go to medicine to relieve my migraine.	1
194851	ive been taking levetiracetam for 10 years now. i take 500mg 2x daily. the first 4 years i experienced little side effects like strange sleep patterns, always tired, and a slight disruption in my ability to concentrate. my seizures were reduced to only 3-4 a year vs. 1-2 a week. in the last five years however the long term side effects have hit me hard...muscle and bone weakness, sciatica, migraines, hair loss, no energy, bouts of rage where i feel outside my body watching a mad woman ( i have always been a calm collected person who never yelled and rarely felt anger), the anger is overwhelming. suicidal ideation, severe depression, complete lack of concentration, inability to think of words ( which is devastating for my love of writing)	0
193492	i've started taking it when i had asthma exacerbation last two months. usually, when i have flare up it will go away within 2 to 3 weeks. i was worried because it's almost a month already and i haven't been feeling well. symptoms are fatigue, chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, rapid heart palpitations, throat irritation, phlegm, reflux? i went to the doctor and told me it was an acid reflux. i still continue to use this drug together with ppi but i don't see any improvement. i've made my research about the side effects. it may control my asthma but the side effects are much worse. i'm getting off this drug immediately.	0
31476	i hate it ! as soon as i inserted the first dosage i have been itching wayyyyyyy worse than before it's pure torture ! ladies please just use tap water &amp; vinegar inside of a douche trust me it works wonders this should be off of the market like seriously !!	0
109232	i have had this implant since december of 2015. it is february 2017 and i have had almost constant bleeding the whole time. at first it was for a few months then stopped for two weeks, and then i'd bleed for months. it ranges from just a spot to a full period. i can stop for a day but it hasn't been longer than a day since maybe october 2016. friends have gotten it and stopped bleeding within 6 months but i'm going to my doctor soon because i'm fed up with this bleeding. it's been over a year and it hasn't stopped. other than that i have not had any pregnancy scares or other issues such as weight gain or depression.	1
211981	my whole life has been a process of up and down, excellency and total failure, elation and depression. finally, since starting lamictal, i have become &quot;normal.&quot; i don't lose my mind when bad things happen or get so excited when good things happen that i forget to tend to other tasks. sure, i get sad. but it's normal sad, it's human-- not this overwhelming and crippling process. same thing with happiness, things make me happy, but not irrationally overjoyed. as a college student, i've decided to commit myself to pre med in the hope of one day becoming a psychiatrist. i want to give other people the same new lease on life i was given. (mind you, talk therapy is also crucial in personal development.)	1
81640	i am 24 and for years i have struggled with my weight. it wasn't super serious until i got in a relationship- i gained nearly 40kg in under a year. at my heaviest i was 116kg. i see a personal trainer, go to zumba, and i thought i was eating well- nothing helped me shed the weight. i got tested for thyroid issues and pcos- neither explained my inability to shed the kgs. i started this drug about 17 days ago. my starting weight was 106.7kg- i now weigh 100.4kg. it has completely changed how i view food, what i crave, and made me realise that whilst the foods i was previously eating were good foods, i was eating far too much because my body had forgotten how to recognise true hunger. i am so excited- it is so worth the money. 10/10!!!	1
2533	i have had horrible acne since taking this birth control. all over my body acne. i didn't realize it could be the birth control until i read a bunch of other reviews on it. my boobs hurt all the time!! no sex drive what so ever! i don't even want my husband to touch me because my boobs hurt so bad. needless to say, i sympathize with some of the other reviewers on this birth control. i will be talking to my doctor to switch to something else. the only good part about it, is not getting my period for 3 months.	0
198647	on depo for 19 months, began taking it after my second child. had no period. major mood swings, constant exhaustion and trouble sleeping. no sex drive- after some research, i discovered why.. depo is used as a chemical castration drug for sex offenders in multiple states. -my dr did not mention that i was drugging myself like a convicted sex offender, did yours?	0
38179	i'm not a complainer but this medicine is the worst. i normally use the regular proair inhaler and it works great but i just got back home from picking up a refill and relied it was this proair respiclick. i can't imagine it working for anyone as a rescue inhaler. did they really test it on real asthma patients? we can't breathe well enough to breathe in this medication. i pray,to god they don't try to phase out the inhaler with this joke of a medication!	0
25084	i had the synvisc-one shot in early may, hoping to be able to dance at my granddaughter's wedding. i had been walking 2 miles a day, five times a week before i had the shot. within 72 hours, i was in horrific pain. i sent my husband out to get a walker. 3 weeks later, i wore a knee brace to the wedding, with a tens unit beneath it to mask the pain. when i called the doctor, he prescribed pain medication. i didn't get it filled. i will not get hooked on pain meds. i have a friend i taught with get hooked on pain meds, and it wasn't pretty. anyway, it is now the end of august, and i still have pain in my knees just sitting in a chair or lying in bed. wished i had read these reviews before having the shot!!!!!!!	0
175093	i had psoriasis for years on my feet. i was prescribed tons of stuff but it never worked then my foot doctor prescribed me coal tar. it not only got rid of my redness and itchiness in weeks but it didn't come back. it's now been 3 yrs since my last breakout.	1
72758	i freaking love minastrin 24 fe! i was on loestrin before, and when the generic came out, was happy to save money, but even better than that, now it's free with my insurance! plus, i've been on this for, i don't know, 8-10 years, and don't have periods. at all. it's awesome! no periods, no cramping, no hormonal issues. yes, i have women ask how can i tell if i'm pregnant, but i just don't worry about it. i use the pill and my husband uses a condom, and honestly, i had more worries about pregnancy before, because if you were a day or two late, it was total meltdown time. now, it's just a non-issue in my mind. there are no negatives to this pill for me.	1
6358	this completely made every zit i had disappear..... but it makes me feel very sick. depends on which outweighs the other but it did work for acne.	1
77833	i have taken this medication many times for pneumonia and bronchitis infections. while it appears to work well, i am concerned about building resistance to this medication.	1
91045	recently i was put on norco for a hand injury sustained several years earlier. it has helped my hand tremendously! i can actually use it. i love the fact that it has less acetaminophen and doesn't make my stomach hurt. it is a miracle.	1
116715	i've seen a psychiatrist and a therapist for year. over a 12 year span, i've probably tried 20-30 drugs. this medication is the first to make me feel human again. i'm not a zombie and i'm not lacking emotion. i'm genuinely happy and thriving. i'm so happy i finally found this medication. i've also not had weight gain, i've actually lost some weight.	1
59959	i would only recommend this birth control to someone that is trying to sleep with my boyfriend-because it made me bloated, bleed constantly for 2 months, back aches (complete period symptoms non stop for 2 months), and gain weight- huge turn offs to anyone. i am in so much bodily discomfort and have been bleeding for so long now it is definitely preventing pregnancy. i cannot wait to switch to another form of birth control. it feels like a combination of irritable bowel syndrome and being pregnant.	0
35347	it was prescribed post surgery as prophylaxis. caused intense pain in the achilles tendon and calf muscles. enough to discontinue use.	0
93755	i was nearly killed in a bicycle verses motor vehicle accident. all things considered i am extremely lucky to be alive and still able to walk. i landed on my head and neck after striking the front corner panel of the vehicle at nearly 40mph. as a result of this i have &quot;mildly bulging discs&quot; in c4-c7(i think c# may be different?) with neural stenosis and syringomyelia, which is a disorder in which a cyst forms within the spinal cord. i was taking 6-8 percocet a day then i moved to loratab and i had a problem with constantly needing more than i was given and i would end up in severe pain for several hours out of the day. then my doctor suggested ms contin and my opiate consumption went down from what it was and my pain control was improved.	1
212799	severe insomnia due to muscle spasm. fibromyalgia since 2001. began tizanidine june 2004. also, 3 bulging discs from negligent car wreck ( driver ran stop sign) since jan 2015. somnolence, dry mouth most common. i've always noticed visual disturbances ( enhanced colors and patterns of whatever i'm viewing before falling asleep after taking tizanidine). experienced noticing &quot; monkeys and grapevines in ceiling while watching tarzan like movie when began drug in 2004. i still can see the enhanced color and pattern of tile or carpet as i walk from bathroom to bedroom shortly before falling asleep. i'm an optometrist with history of excellent ocular health. may 2017 retinal photos revealed &quot; bear-track&quot; like pigment patterns:both eyes. 12mg hs.	1
85081	i have been on this birth control for quite sometime i had many side effects such as weight gain, dizziness/lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, severe onset of migraines and headaches, moodiness. it was a great way to regulate my period and protect against pregnancy i have been on it for 5 years. i stopped taking it for at least 6 months to a year and all of the side effects were gone, however, i became active again and started taking it i have been on it for more than 6 months now and have gained more weight, more headaches/migraines, more moodiness, increased dizziness and lightheadedness, it was a good way to start my periods regularly and to get them on track, but i can do without all of these side effects and being tired all the time.	0
231760	have been fighting insomnia for years. previously on lunesta then ambien because of insurance approval. ambien was no longer working after a year and i came to the conclusion it was due to dependency and i wanted to quit. my doc suggested trazodone as it is non habit forming. tried 50mg and it knocked me out through the night and most of the next day. horrible hangover and dizzy feeling. i layed off for a few days then cut the pill in half to 25mg and was not at all effective. next night took 3/4 of the tab and again knocked me out and zonked most of the next day. think i'm giving on this.	0
45689	was on prozac for 6 weeks and it made me gain weight and feel numb and apathetic about every aspect of my life. i stopped caring about my work performance, stopped wanting to see friends, had low energy yet trouble falling asleep, and had no sex drive whatsoever. the side effects were more depressing than my life was before.	0
133939	i got this as to maintain my period to stay on track/ work with abnormal period. so far it is good unless i miss some days - i have bad habit of missing some on accident. i did notice my acne cleared up pretty well and that has been good. i'm also not sexually active i don't get any mood swings. pill doesn't make me gain or loose weight. i may get kinda sick every once in awhile at my stomach but it does manage to go away.	1
64479	first time i got a panic attack was about 4 years ago, needless to say it was horrifying, took my about three months from one doctor to another to check heart condition, nerves, etc... after my maybe 10th visit to the er (not knowing it's a panic attack) doctor suggested i should i should visit a psychiatric, who prescribed escitalopram and lorazepam, it took me a while before the drugs started acting up but fast forward one year later i'm feeling better. after than i relapsed and the same medication didn't work, so my doctor suggested to start taking sertraline, it took me a couple of weeks before even remotely started to feel slightly better, side effects were horrible, but in 2 months i was back to my normal self. so, be strong, and wait	1
177714	i was in a clinical trial for fibromyalgia with cymbalta. it helped tremendously, i was in a double blind study but could definitely tell the difference in being on a minimal dose and therapeutic dose. this was in 2008 and i have taken it since with great success in improving (not eliminating) the aches and pain. now my doctor wants to wean me off and i don't want to be off of it.	1
4012	in the beginning i was on 300 mg of seroquel (not extended release) for 3 years. got pregnant they took me off. i moved provinces they ended up putting me back on a smaller dose 150mg sleeping wise i would go to sleep right away and stay asleep all night. for the past 2 months they decided to put me on 150mg seroquel xl now it takes me hours to fall asleep and i wake up constantly throughout the night and have a hard time falling back asleep! i feel like xl does not work near as good depression wise and sleeping wise.	0
200521	i took this medicine for 3 weeks and i became a completely different person i got really depressed, very moody, bad headache, vivid dreams, body was achy, nausea and throwing up. i stopped taking it after my 3rd day of not getting out of bed because i was so depressed and nauseated. i have quit smoking before and the depression and moodiness i felt from this medicine is not normal nicotine withdrawal it is definitely side effects from the medicine. on the medicine it took me all i had just to do one load of laundry. i am quitting cold turkey now.	0
129361	since i had the mirena i haven't gotten my period at all. it's been a year and i haven't bled. i have gained a lot of weight specially on my legs and i do get a lot of cramps sometimes.	1
71005	has worked for my condition dermatayocitis well enough that i have gone from needing full time care to being able to care for myself and resume working full time. wonderful results.	1
46634	my doctor put me on gleevec when i was diagnosed with cml five years ago. it has saved my life. i have experienced some of its side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and continual leg pain, but the benefit of living far outweighs any of the bothersome side effects!	1
13195	i am so happy today because i was pregnant and it was 50/50 either my baby can also have it. i'm on my seventh month but with the help of my therapy i took the medicine seriously and now i have my baby and he is negative and i look good too. if i don't tell you am sick with hiv you will never know.	1
37802	reduced my libido to absolutely nothing, daily migraines, cystic acne, cramps became worse, i had no emotions, hair loss/lifeless hair, and i gained 8 pounds within one month of starting this birth control. i just stopped taking this medication and hopefully my body will be able to get back to normal. i have taken other birth control medications in the past and none of them affected me like this one so just beware of reclipsen.	0
14457	this drug is amazing. my father was an addict. he was having horrible back pain and ended up getting addicted to hydrocodone. he turned into someone i didn't know. it was horrible. he went to detox three times and it didn't work. he'd get right back on it once he got back into the real world. a few months after the last detox, his counselor put him in touch with a doctor who worked with addicts and suboxone. since then, he's back to the dad i know. i never thought he'd be able to completely kick the pain pills. i wanted to believe it, but deep down, i just didn't think he could do it, based on his track record. but he did! if you or someone you love is addicted to opiates, try this drug. god bless whoever created it.	1
78853	i was diagnosed with cervical dystonia after months of pain and a few years of wondering what was happening to me. it came to the point where i was depressed and exhausted all of the time and felt things would never ever get better for me. after different medicines, physical therapy and acupuncture i finally was sent to a neurologist who confirmed my dystonia and started botox injections. the first treatment had no effect as they had to start with a small dose so one vile. i had to wait 2.5 months before i could receive another treatment and at that point was given 3 viles. i finally found relief and got my life back. my dystonia will probably forever affect me but with the botox i can barely notice it. it is truly a medical miracle that this works.	1
215385	i was recommended to take senna-s but drug mart said their brand senna-lax was the same thing. i took 2 pills as directed and for the past 5 days i have had explosive constant diarrhea, black liquid, yellow mucous coming out non stop. horrible stomach pain and can not eat and deathly afraid to eat. made me feel worse than the flu. have been in bed 4 days and i am hospice patient so would never ever recommend this. i have had several colonoscopies and their preparation was no way as bad as this. i won't buy drug generics from any drug store again. pay the regular price as the drug mart generics are not worth the results.	0
109979	i got the insert about a month ago after a friend recommended it. everything was fine for the first week and a half then i started getting migraines. i have a pretty high pain tolerance so it shocked me when i couldn't function because of a headache. not thinking anything of it, the head aches began to happen more and more often now i get them everyday. it's gotten to a point where pain medications won't work and i have to sleep the pain off. not only that but i have been having crazy mood swings and depressive episodes. as well as i'm gaining weight and my face is breaking out. i am not a happy camper when it comes to nexplanon i'd much rather use condoms or become a teen mom then to keep this implant in my arm . i do not recommend this	0
86815	had versed for cataract surgery. ok post surgery but woke up from nap afterward with uncontrollable emotions, terrifying. it's 3 1/2 months later and i'm still having occasional flooding of anxiety and depression. also had memory problems for 2 months. horrific experience, i will never be given this drug again.	0
56100	i started using estrace two years ago after major perimenopause symptoms. around this time my periods stopped and i did find quite a bit of relief from vaginal and urethral pain and dryness as well as frequent urination and burning. have gotten along fairly well with several short flareups until recently when i have had a return of my symptoms even though i am still using the estrace. any suggestions or experience with this?	1
200179	i successfully quit on day 6 and stayed for over a year and half with chantix. i did have a few side effects nausea had to take half doses after day 8, vivid but pleasant dreams and constipation but not sure if that was withdrawal or the chantix. i recently started back smoking around the anniversary of my husband's passing and started chantix again 3 days ago. i can already tell the want and desire to smoke is fading and the taste is yuck. i would highly recommend chantix to anyone that is serious about quitting.	1
202804	always have this handy when you travel and are at risk for food poisoning or bad water, it works great. over the counter and very cheap.	1
40438	been using savella (50 mg 2 x daily) for 9 weeks and it's made a huge difference in my pain. not 100% pain-free, still have trigger points etc, but improved my ability to function day to day tremendously. it 'takes the edge off', i've had entire days where i feel almost normal. did have the typical side effects the first two weeks: sweating, rapid heartbeat, agitation and nausea. stuck it out, the side effects subsided and it was worth it. tried a lot of the other medicines recommended for fibromyalgia including cymbalta, lyrica, elavil, flexeril etc. none worked for me - either unable to tolerate side effects or made no difference in my pain. recently missed 2 consecutive doses and the pain came back ferociously, made me realize how much better i've felt.	1
59652	i decided to take the nuvaring because i'm an insane freak on the pill. at first i did notice being moody, crying, along with some weird discharge or itching down there. but after a week the it subsided. my moods are now normal. i barely feel it inside. my boob size definitely has increased and my weight is still fine in fact the 5lbs i put on i definitely needed. it's only the first month of use so i definitely have to wait and see how it goes but overall i do love it. i absolutely hated the pill and how it made me feel and the nuvaring is nothing like that.	1
195886	flu like symptoms, totally unable now to control my blood sugar (way too high 150 to 200 i'm 5'6&quot; and weigh 220), totally unable to control my blood pressure -its 220/110.very regularly i'm a heart patient on ranexa, -on depression -some improvement (very little) on anxiety every day i take it my confrontational assertiveness and anger continue to grow, i have some serious meds for insomnia that are now useless, totally not sleeping. i may have to &quot;admit&quot; myself to get a better solution sooner.	0
48299	i am 59, non smoker, confirmed nsclc. found egfr mutation gene, prescribed tarceva. skin rash and fatigue started within a week, and continue to worsen. have to stop after a month. i feel the drug is making me sick and causes a lot of pain, and lower quality of life.	0
3052	works great, little side effects. i will get a little stomach upset if i don't take with food, which you should do. i am not sure why the reviews are bad unless you are allergic. my uti symptoms start to disappear with one pill. fast relief.	1
23697	i have used this medicine for two years and by far the best treatment for my multiple sclerosis. no side effects, and i don't have to take daily shots. i would recommend this to anyone who has multiple sclerosis.	1
132779	i had woke up around 5 this morning sick to my stomach. not horrible, but i could feel the nausea coming on. i may need to explain i deal with gastroparesis. most days i'm fine, but the days i'm not, it's really bad. i tried zofran and promethazine with no relief whatsoever. finally was admitted to the er. found out i was dehydrated and of course the gastroparesis had shown its ugly head. nothing, i repeat nothing was working for nausea. they finally decided to give me compazine in iv form. within just a few minutes i could tell results. great drug and for myself minimal to no side effects.	1
199419	this is the best birth control i have been on so far! i used to be on the pill and it made my periods irregular, made me gain a crazy amount of weight, made my acne worsen, made me super emotional all the time, and many other bad side effects. i was off birth control for a couple of months and was back to my normal self and actually lost about 50 pounds. my doctor thought i should take birth control again and recommended that i switch to this, so i took a chance. i had one period after i got my first shot (about 8 months ago) and haven't had one since. the only bad side effect that i have had with this shot is i gained a little bit of my weight back.	1
155010	negative experience. if you are having anorexia, and nausea ... especially if you have vomiting and diarrhea...and start feeling weak, go back to the doctor. on day 5 i went to the e.r. and then admitted (for 9 hours) for lo sodium - was dehydrated. attending felt it was a combo of f w/the diuretic i take ... altho it's quite a low dose, and i stopped on day 3. they gave me ivs of saline, mg, k (all were low) with saline labs every 2 hours. don't fool around with this. get seen. i'm not sure what would have happened had i waited.	0

63716	i have been using tactuo for about two months to treat severe cystic acne. so far so good! i do still have scarring and dark spots but they are fading with time. the first couple of weeks were really terrible- more acne than i had ever had, dry burning skin. but it gets better! i usually take one night off of the gel per week to give my face a break, but still use the cetaphil foam wash every morning and evening. my oily skin has been significantly balanced out and i am hoping it keeps up. it should be noted that i started diane 35 the same time as the epiduo. whether it's the gel or the combination of birth control and gel, i'm not sure. all i know is i am not crying myself to sleep every night and my confidence is returning!	1
59758	the nuva-ring caused a depression for me after just 1,5 months use. i became depressed a few weeks after beginning, and it only became worse.	0
212372	improved my life 100% after struggling for 58 years. noticed results within days. now taking for over a year with no side effects.	1
200659	it has been day 8 now and i have had no cigarettes, you also have to put your mind to it that you really want to quit. i have had some vivid dreams but no nightmares. no other major bad symptoms that i have noticed at this point. i feel so much better already and plan to quit forever! i am 56 yrs young.	1
186358	i take 100 mg. it works but side effects were i was always tired and gained weight. took wellbutrin with it when i was taking 50mg. that made me feel close to normal but i got headaches and gained weight. i was good enough with just the pristiq, but not great. the doctor then added dextroamphetamine, which now has me feeling normal, like when i was in my 20's. i have motivation, energy, focus, no panic, no depression and once again feel the wide range of emotions as they are meant to feel. i am able to take joy in the small things in life and not dwell on the down sides. my weight has also adjusted back to pre-medication size.	1
55342	i've been taking this for one week so far, it has no effect on my appetite. in fact i feel like i am more hungry	0
142884	i got this inserted in april .. going on 5 months now. i have had period , after period, after period and they last about 2 weeks.. no sex drive, headaches, acne, mood swings like no other. i'm tired of feeling sick to my stomach day in and day out. how am i supposed to care for my 7 yr old while going through this?!?! all my doctor told me is it's not regulated yet give it 4-6 months.. 4-6 months???? i get cramps but not the normal period cramping.. it's down lower and hurts like hell :(. i wanted this to work out but i'm not going to go through this for 3 yrs..	0
116644	i have struggled with severe anxiety and major depression for 30 years. i have been on many different anxiety meds and anti depressants. the only 2 meds that helped slightly were paxil and ativan for panic/anxiety. i was diagnosed with bipolar about 5 years ago and once again tried other meds. i heard about lamictal helping other people, so my doctor said we could try it. it has been a lifesaver!! i still take paxil and ativan, but after the first few days of taking lamictal, it helped tremendously with my mood swings. but most important, it improved my anxiety by at least 75% if not more. it has been a godsend for me. i take 100mg a day. thanks.	1
182525	i had the mirena inserted in 3/05, loved it, no complaints. 1 tiny one, her name is gabriella, i found out that while the mirena was still in i was pregnant (3 years into my 5years). we were very nervous, i was using the mirena because of severe possibility of birth defects with medications i was taking. she is our miracle and we have been blessed. the 99.9% effective is very prominent.	0
127582	i first started taking phen back in feb 2016 i was 200lbs, by august 2016 i was 149! so it works! i got pregnant that month and gained it all back plus an extra 8lbs, had baby in april i stopped breastfeeding this month and decided to get back on this medication, started last week on july 12th weighing in at 208.8 july 19th i'm down to 200, so almost 9 lbs in a week! i'm hoping to get down to 130	1
112917	took one at 9am, had little effect and just made me gassy. took another at 1pm, had a bm approx. two hours later, still experiencing some discomfort though so i don't think it's done a very thorough job.	1
132733	i went to the er for stomach pains and nausea. i am allergic to so many pain medicines that there is little i can take. they gave me compazine and as they put it in my iv they told me it could cause severe anxiety in some people. well i can tell you now, it was horrific. i have had one major panic attack in my life and this was 20 times worse. i started pulling off my clothes and ripped the iv out. they had to give me a big dose of benedryl to &quot;reverse&quot; the effects. please please think twice and consider other choices before taking this!	0
140532	been on it about 2weeks don't feel any better	0
3922	i have suffered with constipation for years after having a major surgery. the pain would be in my lower back and made it difficult for me to stand particularly in the early morning. i have been taking over the counter acidophilus pills (3) times a day with meals and i don't experience the excruciating pain anymore. i carry my pills in purse. i highly recommend these tablets.	1
212514	i've had the virus for about 5 months now and once i first got the virus i was having out breaks every 2-3 weeks. i've been talking lysine pills for about a month now and i swear this is the beat thing i could have ever found out about! i haven't have an outbreak since i started taking them! sometimes i take 2 pills a day when i feel like i might get an outbreak but these things really work. i would recommend these to everybody with this virus. they are a life saver literally!	1
180314	i had a bad reaction to this medicine; trouble breathing, tight throat, cold hands and feet, increased pulse, strong headache, then fatigue. it was very frightening, but did go away after several hours.	0
50187	i started off with a relatively low dose of 300mg once a day. after starting the medication, i began to pass out regularly and could not see straight. my anxiety did not change. i returned to my psychiatrist and he lowered the dosage to 100mg, once a day and although i no longer experience side effects, i still have not noticed any changes to my anxiety and suffer anxiety attacks daily.	0
59551	i have chronic sinusitis and have taken many different antibiotics including cefazolin, erythromycin, azithromycin, augmentin, and ampicillin. i have never felt the nearly immediate relief with any of these that i felt when i took avelox.	0
229379	none. i was prescribed this by my specialist as an alternative to lamotrigine for some unknown reason. i took a look at the side effects and decided it was incompatible with being able to work. after all, if i can't work, i can't afford treatment.	0
115680	one week after the 5th loading dose of 300 mg, my lips swelled to twice their normal size, became itchy and then erupted in blisters. my gums became sore, itchy and throbbing. i got a very red eye and began having itching on various other body parts, starting with my toes.	0
36429	i feel like i have been poisoned . even though people react differently to every medication i'm sure this one beats all bad side effects by a long way . after having h pylori i began with pylera treatment for 10 days.... couldn't get through it for more than 7 days as my health started taking a heavy toll. headaches, mood swings, bloating, painful constipation, extreme fatigue, chills and then i stopped when i had a hives allergic attack which obliged me to stop working. i'm an otherwise healthy 32 yr old who has had her life turned upside down by pylera. after stopping treatment i noticed i had developed an oral thrush due to antibiotics killing my intestinal flora and was sick in bed. be warned as to the bad side effects and look for natural remedies!	0
19013	librium works amazing for detoxing from alcohol. period. i suffer from major anxiety which is why i drank to keep my nerves calm. well years of doing that leads to dependency, withdrawals and leads to more anxiety. so i talked to the doc, got librium which was very affordable. i started on a sunday and drank myself away the night before so soon as i started feeling the anxiety i took my recommend dose. within 10 mins i felt great, curbed all the shakes, relaxed me to the point of zero anxiety was a life saver. been sober for 20 days now and still dealing with little twinges of anxiety, but i have xanax and just nervous to take it. side note here, coming off librium i would consider it slightly rough. especially for people with anxiety.	1
134553	chronic excruciating back pain, given ketorolac 10mg ever 4 hours. have taken two so far and it hasn't helped at all. really disappointed as i haven't been sleeping, i'm suffering and advil works better than this!	0
200337	i started chantix about two months ago and i can't say enough about how absolutely amazing this medication has worked for me. i could feel a difference by day two and i have been completely smoke free since week one. i have about a month left in my prescription and i continue to take it. i have refills for the year if i feel i need it but i have no desire whatsoever to smoke and i just want to say thank you to the medicine for hopefully saving my life. i'm a 42 year old rn and i have been smoking 5 years. not real long but long enough. i had a crazy dream night one and nothing since- no side effects at all. i was nervous to start the medicine due to the stories we have all heard but i figured the benefit outweighed the risk. good decision.	1
103997	i've been on probably at least 20 different forms of birth control for one reason or another, usually due to painful cramps and heavy flow. i've noticed in the almost 2 years of taking it, my period is down to 2 days that i get 4 times a year. i get severely depressed for one day, the day i go off of them to get my period, and my cramps are not as bad as they usually were. they are now about a 6 on a 1-10 scale when they had been a 12 in the past. overall, pretty pleased with it. i have gained about 10 lbs over 2 years but like most women have said, it's water retention. i have a very healthy libido and haven't had any spotting.	1
108103	so far so good, no side effects other than a bit of nauseousness. i did the quick start method, meaning i didn't start either i the day of my period or on the first sunday after my period. i have no idea if that makes you get less side effects. nevertheless, i followed the instructions used backup for 1 week. after that didn't use a condom anymore' so i'm hoping it's effective !!!	1
125920	this by far is the best anti-depressant i've been on. if you're looking for a medication that does not cause drowsiness or weight gain, this is for you. normally they say it takes time to feel effects, but i felt alertness and motivation right away. i had more energy and a clearer mind, better concentration. the recommended dose is to incrementally increase 10mg-40mg, but i stayed at 20mg - too much caused rls and mild insomnia. i too struggle with sad and this medication has really helped me get through the winter blues. lost 10 lbs on this medication as i felt less hungry. remember: there are so many natural ways to help with depression as well and i recommend that you explore these too. good luck!	1
72660	i loved being on this pill. the only reason why i stopped is because i am way too busy to take it at the same time every day, so i now have a birth control implant. i did not gain weight. acne... well, i've always had bad acne, even before birth control. i was secretly hoping it would clear it up, which it did not, but it definitely did not get worse. no weight gain, etc. lightened my cycles for the fist year, then afterwards i would regularly get my period every other month, and then i would never get it (and take tests when i was worried.) towards the end (i was on it for years), i was horrible with taking it on time-- there were days i would even forget to take it. with back up protection, i still was never pregnant. loved this pill.	1
128093	40 yr old female. 5'3&quot; started on 37.5 mg of phentermine, july 9th. starting weight was 200.4. today is july 11th and i weigh, 194.6. i'm sure its water weight, but i'm still losing. yay! haven't been able to get much sleep since being on it, and dry mouth, hence the water increase. don't feel hungry, but i do eat. i'm curious as to how much more i will be able to lose. first goal weight is, 170. second goal is 150.	1
217248	avoiding levaquin so taking biaxin genic. felt better but developed sore throat , cold. not feeling better still lethargic, severe stomach pain, indigestion. called for a substitute but doctor has not followed up yet. do not recommend this antibiotic!!!	0
54157	i think it&rsquo;s crazy that medicine specifically prescribed to opioid users will cause opioid withdrawal. forget that! take linzess ! i&rsquo;ve been on suboxone for 3 years. i&rsquo;ve had terrible constipation and when i would finally go, it would be rock solid and extremely painful. linzess has been life changing. i go everyday. i&rsquo;m on the highest dosage, the low dosage did absolutely nothing at all. being constipated is a big deal. it&rsquo;s awful! my heart goes out to anyone who suffers from it.	0
95833	after a month of bouncing between morning and night dosing of 1 50mg pill, i settled on morning. it was making me super sleepy but that went away mostly. didn't gain but maybe 5lbs if that (i'm a gym rat somewhat). felt really stoned the first week or so and sleeping was strange, maybe a little erectile dysfunction at first, but all of that went away too. a month in and the side effects are minimal. the panic is under control, but the depression is completely gone. thanks a million zoloft.	1
158190	other then feeling numb on geodon (partly i think my antidepressant too) i love it. i've been on geodon for a little over a year. honestly i'll probably die taking this drug. it has saved me and brought me back to reality, after a mania-induced psychosis a year and a half ago. i'm almost never paranoid anymore, i can function in my day to day life, i am stable. i've even been able to cut down dramatically on how much i take.	1
115440	i was given this medication after i gave birth to my daughter via cesarean. i had eclampsia and seized on the table and then experienced respiratory failure when my lungs filled with fluid. i was in the micu on this drug for 5 days. it was effective and i came out of it pretty quickly. my biggest side effect was weakness and extreme lethargy for several weeks after, although a part or whole of this could be contributed to the other medical things that were occurring at the same time.	1
117592	started suffering with severe migraines 2 years ago, presented with sensitivity of light, extreme sickness and impaired cognitive function. started off on 10mg nortriptyline, increased to 25mg and now 50mg and now i only get migraines once a month, been on it for a year and seen an incredible improvement.	1
127701	i started with 15mg capsules as my dr. said that the higher does(30 or 37.5mg) can make it easier to gain the weight back after you are off the pill in 3 months- she will allow no more than 3 months on the pills- i did not find that 15mg really helping me much so i asked her to increase me to the 37.5- i have had no side effects with 15mg so i am a little bit worried after having horrible side effects with contrave- i plan to do half in the am and half in the afternoon with the 37.5 and see how that goes- i am wondering if i should take a break when we go on vaca for a week in april?	1
204959	iv excellent 5 star***** oral 3 star ***	1
145852	i tried this medicine for 2 months, i lost 9 lbs. it was hard falling asleep at night, most nights i couldn't fall asleep until 4 or 5 am. it also made me feel depressed.	0
112518	i have been on ambien for years. at one period of time, not living in this country i was prescribed 20 mls a night. back here in the us i have been put on 12.5 extended release. i usually take 1 and a half to get me to sleep with 2 phenergan. i crave sweet things after taking it. i run out halfway through the month. i was getting a supply from india of 10mls too for 150 dollars but ran out of those this week. i was given to try lunesta 3 mls i have been awake for hours after taking the lunesta plus 2 phenergan and 300 mls of gabapentin. i have been to a sleep center as well. they wanted to take me off all sleep meds except for gabapentin and gave me a sleep machine. totally useless, a lot of money. ambien for me are way better than anything	0
18382	i was prescribed this medication for joint pain and swelling in the elbows and feet. took for 2 months. last week my doctor had to take me off because i developed allergy to the medication with rash and low fever. worked okay but not worth the allergic reaction.	0
44015	i have no sex drive and i am always spotting. the spotting has even gotten worse - now i have two periods a month. i have been taking the pill for almost a year, and the side effects have not subsided - they have gotten worse. i had to change birth control because of cost, i guess you get what you pay for.... sorry sprintec my body does not like you.	0
87153	this drug is the devil.its evil! some drugs are not for everyone and this one is not for me! be careful.	0
21688	i disagree with the other reviews, two doses and i'm feeling a bit better with the antibiotics. only downfall so far. nausea!	1
213644	never again will i use monistat ovule. i am burning ,itching and just irritated down there!!!!! i was not like this before monistat!!!!! never again	0
61489	citalopram works great for me. i've been on and off of it for about 5 years. when i was on it several years ago it was like night and day. i have major depression and general anxiety. when going back on it most recently (4 months ago), i started at 20mg for the first month. the first dose helped my anxiety immensely. within a few weeks my depression lifted some. i'm now on 40mg again and it is definitely helping, but i feel like in the past it worked better for the depression. so today i've started 5mg abilify in addition; hoping it will help some more.	1
154980	i've had this medication twice now, once for bv and once for another illness. even though it was effective in treating the infections, the pills had some very uncomfortable side effects including drowsiness, fatigue, upset stomach, and a dry cotten mouth with a horrible taste. i felt as though i had some sort of flu that would ease as each pill would wear off, but then i had to take another. i truly dreaded taking the next pill. i hope other people faired better.	0
55029	horrible. took one pill as directed on first morning. within an hour, increased heart rate, pupils dilated, uncontrollable diarrhea. had to leave work, even felt like i had the flu. i only need to lose about 15 lbs. my doctor should have never prescribed this drug for me.	0
92734	after 3 1/2 months of using limbrel i became vilolently ill. i had extreme nausea, vomiting, feverish, chills, achy. my primary doctor ran blood work and it came back that i was anemic with liver problems. after 15 days of feeling like i had food poisoning, i searched online and found that there were dozens of people with the same symptoms and some even went to the hospital. i stopped taking the limbrel right away and started feeling better within 48 hrs. after 7-8 days i was back to 100%.	0
25910	did not work! used the 12 week treatment. saw an improvement and after cutting off the whole nail it looked like it was growing back healthy. fast forward to now and the other nail is doing the same thing the first one did. not only that but the first nail is still not growing back properly and is starting to turn yellow...again! it's like the medicine didn't even kill all of it. now i have to figure out something else as the second stupid nail is turning yellow and starting to have the same issues as the first.	0
6644	i found mysoline effective for my essential tremor, but the side effects of tiredness, lack of energy, plus reduced sexual function (difficulty in ejaculating) is quite frustrating.	1
172370	i've been on clonazepam for five years now. i take it for general anxiety disorder. this is a miracle drug. i don't care what the critics say about the idea that it's addictive or that you build up a tolerance or any of the other hundreds of negative things they say about this drug. all the negative effects they claim you'll experience haven't happened to me. and trust me, if anyone feels the side effects of drugs, it's me. all the cold and flu medications, antihistamine, etc. that say they are non drowsy (i.e. clartin) knock me out completely. sure, this drug is addictive, but so is your heart medication. if you go off it, you might get a heart attack. listen to the doctors, not the internet.	1
106639	i was on implanon for exactly one year before i got it removed. i did not like this birthcontrol as i had horrible side-effects. i chose this birth control because the only birth control i've been on was depo the shot, which i got every three months, so i thought three years that's great. however after about 6 months i felt as though i was losing weight, i had what felt like constant spotting, so my menstruation never stopped it felt like and my libido was in over-drive. so the doctor said one year to the day i got it took out and went back on the shot, where i'll stay.	0
37471	my 9 year old son has been on vyvanse for five years now he started out with 20mg he is now up to 70mg it works great my 5yr old little girl was just put on vyvanse 40mg after trying numerous other adhd medicines. it works well, i was on ritalin for 25 years. i did not want my kids on that so glad the vyvanse works.	1
11248	i was on loestrin fe for 5 years and i was also diagnosed with bi-polar disorder while i was in high school. loestrin worked for a little bit but i gained 20 pounds quick. i still had sexual desire mentally but my body wouldn't react and i was always too tired or to moody or to emotional. and since i've been on it for a while the side effects seemed like they hit me a second time and it was like my period was playing peek-a-boo with me. but 3 months ago i switched to beyaz and i've never been more happy and more...well....attacking my fiance. i give beyaz a 10 and highly recommend it! and i'm 20.	1
21196	i was severely anemic, with muscle cramping throughout my body. restless legs at night and tingling in my fingers. i had chest pain, and my memory and focus were off. all of my symptoms completely disappeared and i could sleep through the night for the first time in years. i regained my energy and felt alive again. i had no side effects at all. saw immediate results. i took one pill twice a day, with orange juice.	1
142507	my mirena caused severe cramping 4 days a week, an inflamed cervix, and caused weight gain. doc kept saying i was just adjusting. after 1.5 years i got it out and feel so much better. seriously consider how this can affect your health.	0
109253	first and foremost, i will never ever in life get this stupid nexplanon again. ever! i been bleeding for 3 months straight! i can't tell you guys how much money i spent on pads and tampons. i needed both because sometimes tampons were pointless to use when my period was light. second, i been depressed with major mood swings. i had crying episodes and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. my bf thought i became bipolar. which in a sense i did due to this implant. third, i lost weight (9lbs). no matter how much i eat i cannot gain my weight back and that is not like my body at all. this thing does not work for me. i'm getting this removed asap!!! i'm telling you guys it's the worse ever in life. i'm going back to the pill.	0
9014	i used it for 3 weeks and then my dr instructed me to stop using it for a week and by the next week my condition completely flared up again. i know this medication works extremely well at treating the condition and preventing it from additional flare ups. i have plantar psoriasis on the balls of both feet. it starts out with bumps under the skin and in 2-4 days they become big water filled blisters that are the size of a dime, most of them are the size of a quarter and the largest one i had was bigger than a half dollar. they were 75percent healed when i had to stop using it for a week and on day 5 i felt more bumps under the skin. sure enough i have 5 more on the ball of the same foot in the same area. good grief. it's very painful.	1
112346	as like so many others have posted, i too have had major depression,bi-polar disorder,and anxiety. i've been on every med imaginable for these diagnoses and they all have stopped working. my current regimen is cymbalta 90mg bid and zyprexa 5mg @bedtime. i now have been taking gabapentin 400mg tid. (i'm also a recovering opiate addict.) anyways, the gabapentin seems to give me a pleasant type of calmness. i am saying tons of prayers that this is the missing piece for me. i'll try anything to get my life back. anything	1
45942	i had taken prozac for approximately 20 years when i noticed my depression was coming back and i felt it was no longer working for me. i then started on the path of trying everything on the market; none of them seemed to work and that has been over the last 6 years. now i'm thinking about asking my doctor to switch me back to prozac and see perhaps if it was helpful just being off it for while, give my system a break and maybe it will work again for me.	1
149007	got mirena at my 6 week post-partum checkup. first baby, had him w/o an epidural, and wow. the iud insertion hurt worse than childbirth. i bled for 2 months straight after insertion and my husband said the cords felt like wires stabbing him for the next year. 3 years later and i wish we had money for my husband's vasectomy. i get brutal cramping almost 24/7, intercourse is painful for me if my husband thrusts too deep, i get intensely nauseous during my period and my period is very heavy, i recently got pelvic inflammatory disease, and the cords can still be felt by my husband both the day before and the day after my period. the only 'pluses' about this iud is that i didn't have to pay for it and i haven't got pregnant again.	0
213795	i thought i had a yeast infection &amp; verified that w/ an over-the-counter test. i used monistat 1 thinking the itching and discomfort would stop. after about 1 hour, the egg came out in a gloppy mess. i experienced severe itching and burning. i got in the shower and tried to get the monistat off of me. eventually the shower ran cold, and my efforts were in vain. the itching and burning became more intense. i felt like a baby because i had to grit my teeth not to yell in frustration. as to my pain tolerance, i have several tattoos in sensitive areas. i'd get my hoo-ha tattooed before i ever used monistat again. it would hurt less. i tried the anti-itch/burn cream for help. it made it worse. i iced my crotch &amp; begged my spouse for cranberry juice	0
6777	the only reason i got on beyaz was because i developed 2 very large ovarion cysts. my doctor recommended the pill to reduce ovulation wihich would only make the cyst bigger. i was scared that i was going to gain weight. at first i hated the pill because i bleed very lightly for an entire month. my doctor said that was normal for the first month. then i noticed that my skin was clearing up really nicely. i didn't notice any weight gain, but the best part was beyaz sorted my monthly cramps. i was so relieved. the only thing i can say that i don't like about byaz is that if i miss a pill and take it when i remember it seems like over the next 2 or 3 days my acne flares up really bad, and i hate that. just stay consistent, i recommend it 100%.	1
210132	i shared my experience in june/2016 when i started taking linzess &amp; it was great at first. unfortunately, the diarrhea continued every day and my stomach got big &amp; bloaty, headaches &amp; acne!? i tried every second day, at night, with more water but as time went on the side effects got worse. i was going to the bathroom, but not completely, with all the water &amp; gas remaining inside. i read posts about weight gain and watched myself carefully, everything i ate and worked out but suddenly noticed i was &quot;puffy&quot;. i realized i was dehydrated from the linzess and i stumbled across an acticle saying &quot;dehydration slows down metabolism&quot;! i also started feeling a little down, i got off &amp; back to my old drug resolor! side effects gone &amp; i feel better!	0
71821	i take 2 50 mg of tramadol at 4 pm for backaches,thought they would be like an aspirin but wow no pain in the evenings! and i realize i have a calm mind not wasted or anything just a feeling of calm,can stand up right away without pain in my lower back and i only need tramadol during the middle of the weektuesday to thursday or wednesday to friday,if you don't want to be a druggie use tramadol.	1
81486	started 9/1/17 and have had no appetite and when i make myself eat it doesn't taste the same...diet coke is the only thing appealing...no side effects other than diarrhea when i do eat...37 years old, 5'7 212 lbs...needing to make my goal weight of 160	1
31276	after three weeks of antibiotic for an upper respiratory infection i developed a yeast infection. my doctor prescribed fluconazole 100 mg and monistat 7. the burning from the cream vaginally i thought was part of the curing process. after 3 days i had burning so bad i stopped using it. now after 3 doses of flucon. and trying monistat periodically again burning like fire ants in my crotch i am returning to my doc screaming!!! no monistat will ever be used again by me	0
228740	i have a 10 yr old daughter ( bi polar, anxiety and adhd ) who has been taking geodon for about two months and it's been working great! i think the most important thing to remember is to go slow. 20mg for a couple weeks then 40mg for a couple weeks and so on and so forth. it does make you tired at 1st but it wears off after a while. my daughter was 1st on risperdal for a couple years starting at age 6 but it stopped working well and she was gaining a lot of weight. then we eased her into abilify and she was on it for 2 years and still was gaining to much weight. i don't think the abilify ever worked that effectively and she was just getting out of control.	1
59773	yesterday i stopped using nuvaring for the 2nd time. the first time i quit i wasn't sure if it was the ring causing my depression or just the things going on in my life at the time. a year later i went back on it because i became more sexually active and i loved not having periods and the clear skin it gave me. the first 2 months it gave me horribly sore boobs, i also noticed i was a little moody but thought it would go away once i regulated after 3 months. 7 months in and i'm a full blown basket case with life ruining depression and anxiety. i'm mad i was on denial that nuvaring was causing it for so long. do your relationship/mental health a favor, do not use nuvaring. i feel so bad for my boyfriend for putting up with me for so long.	0
113699	i have osteoarthrititis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and sciatica and have tried many other pain medicines with celebrix being the last. i am taking arthrotec 50mg 3x a day and by the second day i was very pleased with the results. my pain has lessened from a 7-8 down to a 2-4 level. i have vicodin as a stand by and haven't taken any this past month, i went from taking 1 to 3 a day to none, that is a good thing!!	1
72053	it works a little when it wants too. i am not impressed with it and would not recommend this medication for moderate to severe pain.	0
169606	november 2015, i saw my doctor about headaches - he saw a correlation to 'a stubborn cold' which i did not have active signs of and suggested otc meds or later prescribe meds with steroids. the major problem with my 'bad' headaches diminished until a week before christmas - migraines, not just bad headaches. on wednesday, 1/6/2016, i went to an emergency clinic and was prescribed fiorinal, specifically to address migraines. any time my headaches were severe, i ate and took two fiorinals. the pills did nothing to diminish my headaches. instead, i napped often with a blindfold. today, 1/11/2016, i took two before work. i rated my migraine at 7-8 out of 10 (high pain). at work, took 1 otc (brand name) migraine pill; rate a 4.	0
228299	i became unconcious, and some how showed positive for cocaine. don't really understand how this can happen. i've never taken &quot;street drugs&quot;. as a result of the false positive i can't even get any meds. the drs. are running so scared with all this miss use of pain killers, that they won't give it to the ones that need it.	0
227176	nexplanon is my first birth control. i have had it for about 5 months now. i had it inserted about 8 weeks after i had my first baby. for the first week after it was inserted, i had a &quot;normal&quot; period and after that, it went away and i have not had another period at all (not even spotting!) i have not gained weight. i have not had any side effects. if you don't want periods, i think it works best if you are breastfeeding at the time you get it.	1
225293	i'm 52 and have had depression my entire life. years ago tried wellbutrin with no effect. had a genetic test which indicated this medicine should work; however, i must take l - tyrosine with it because i can't convert phenylalanine to tyrosine on my own. this makes dopamine which wellbutrin then uptakes. for the first time ever i can hang my clothes up and not be cluttered, i don't leave cabinet doors open or a trail from where i have been. my appetite has normalized where i feel satiated with a modest meal. i am a slow metabolizer so 300mg xl is too much, i had to go to 150mg. the genetic test also showed i don't convert b12 very well but store it so i take cerefolin nac for a special prescribed kind that is helping energy.	1
37031	it's quite remarkable. it has eased both cravings and withdrawal.	1
124841	this bc helped with acne but i also used epiduo with it. the first month was great no nausea or headaches(i'm prone to headaches). my acne was mild and this pill helped clear it up a lot, along with epiduo. the 2nd month was where all the problems started. within 2 days of the first week i started getting headaches along with nausea and vomiting. it was awful i threw up every night while taking this. i had a headache for 4 days straight as well. i'm not even to my second week of the second month of taking this and i can't do it anymore it's not worth it for me. my hormones are crazy, i'm not use to being so emotional and crying all the time. i wanted this pill to help clear up my mild acne, but i don't care anymore, this isn't worth it.	0
6132	md prescribed my 21 yo daughter this med without mentioning the $300 price tag it carries (for 3 month supply). i will not be accepting the delivery of this ridiculous scamming of patients.	0
98733	have had nexplanon since 12/11/12. it was fine for awhile, until my boyfriend started complaining that we never have sex anymore. then i realized that we really didn't. i have always been a tad moody, and already had depression issues. nexplanon made them worse. the worst thing of all was that unfortunately my boyfriend started becoming extremely jealous thinking i was having sex with someone else. i couldn't figure out what happened to my sexual appetite for the longest time. then it dawned on me, it had to be the implant. i didnt have much of a problem with implanon, just moodiness. i can honestly say if i were not in a relationship, it would probably be great, but starting nexplanon ruined my relationship, and my selfesteem. too bad.	0
142557	the only reason i'm not giving kyleena a 10 is because of my acne. i am going into my 3rd month of having this iud. i switched from a low dose birth control pill. i love the iud because i don't have to remember to take a pill everyday! the first two months have been rough. i have broke out all over my face, chest, and back. nothing will make it go away it's so bad. the 1st month was okay didn't have much spotting just for about 3 days and it was light. the second month i got my period right on time but had it for 17 days straight. also found a cyst on my right ovary. i'm just now starting to get more energy but i have been exhausted for the last two months. i will update again after being on it for 3 months.	1
225269	i got diagnosed with adhd very early in life. they had me an adderall. i stopped taking it around age 18. now that i'm 21 and the adhd is still prevalent i went to get help. they started me on welbutrin to hell curb the depression and maybe help with the adhd. i think my depression is cause by the adhd. not depression is cause adhd. the welbutrin hasn't done to much for the adhd side, but has helped with mood. i'd give a higher rating if this was depression.	0
65052	works great for sleep and controls mania well, but caused my depression to increase. this was after being on the medication for several months (10mg/night). didn't particularly like the next-day hangover either. i've recently been switched over to lithium but it's too early to tell how it's working. i took one saphris tablet last night per doctor's request, after being off it for some time (as a sleep aid) but felt hung over and a bit depressed most of the day.	0
196789	i previously posted on here in december 2016 when i first started taking them for depression, anxiety, trichtillomania . i was on 30mg of paroxetine until now, i've had to come off them. i've been a complete zombie for 6 months, i slept 12 hours a night, had no interest in doing anything, exercise was impossible. headaches, snacking, lack of concentration. it was like i still had anxiety just the symptoms were numbed. since stopping taking this medicine i feel alive. i am still sick but i am able to get up and go to the gym and i only need 8 hours or less sleep. i came off cold turkey, it was very stupid but i needed relief from this med. i'm feeling much more alive. i think i'll need meds again but i won't be using paroxetine (or sertraline or citalopram!)	0
108771	to start: i have menstrual migraines because i create too much estrogen. i cannot use birthcontrol that contains estrogen. i chose to get nexplanon 7 weeks after having my first baby. before i had the baby, i had an iud which i loved, but the process of getting it implanted was extremely painful because i have a tilted uterus. so i decided to try nexplanon. i've had this in for about a year during which i've basically never stopped bleeding. very light mostly - can wear a liner. but it never stops. extremely low sex drive. moody. told by doc this would all stop after &quot;some time&quot;. planning to get it removed soon. i will never use this form of bc again - i don't care that it's the most effective on the market; side effects are miserable.	0
63323	this made my skin incredibly sensitive and irritated all the time, it dried out my cheeks and nose, it didn't get rid of hardly any acne. i have to stop using after only about 2 months of use due to the sensitivity.	0
53662	this birth control pill was diagnosed for my pcos and worked well for the first few months but then it gave me severe gallstones and i ended up having to have a gallbladder removal surgery.	1
203140	made me itch to no end, itch all night itch all day. lots of dry mouth, it did relieve pain and i liked the pain relief. as we all know they do not stay on for 3 days, after about 50 some hours it stop relieving pain.	1
406	i had this depo for two years and as much as it was easier with no pill no period etc it ended up the worst thing i've ever had i have developed cystic acne hard nodular lumps under my skin which have left me depressed with how they look. they were awful and my hair was shedding rapidly. i went to the doctor and came off it he put me on dianette and advised to take it the first day i come on. 3 months in and no proper period. one weekend i suffered severe and i must emphasize severe pain and cramping i could not move and was having very dark blood clots. to this day my skin is still awful i am now on lymecyline and the doctors told me to use the dianette contraceptive for my skin anyway. i have never ever had skin problems previous to this.	0
30455	i tried this for my rsd/crps and it helped lower my baseline pain from a 7 to a 4 within 48 hours. i stopped taking it after 2 months to test it and the pain increased again within 3 days. it worked great for me, but no two rsd cases are alike. good luck all in finding relief sooner rather than later.	1
130721	history: switched directly from depo-provera after 3 years of use. age 24. experience: yes, it hurt. the girl at planned parenthood called it &quot;the vasovagal response&quot; which is fancy for &quot;feeling like you're going to pass out and throw up&quot;. i've donated over a gallon of blood all total (pint by pint since i was 17) and am familiar with the feeling. juice, water, rest and i was able to drive home. i advise having a ride home prepared! i get motion sickness and was fighting hard the whole drive. about a day in bed with a hot pad, my body likes to sleep pain off. moving hurt, laying still hurt. i advise rolling back and forth so that the pressure is evenly distributed. &quot;menstrual-like cramps&quot; for a week. 4 months, now great, no pain or bleed.	1
30195	i've had gad for 30 years. the last 5 years it's gotten worse, my normal techniques weren't working anymore and i needed help. i take the smallest amount of klonopin 0.25 mg once per day and it level's things out.	1
74543	i'm 15 and using this birth control to regulate my period. this is the first pill i've been on and i've been taking it for 5 days only. it gave me serious side effects and an allergic reaction. i have a red rash on my face, severe stomach pains and vomiting.	0
131863	as long as i am on 225 mg i do just fine.	1
6606	i have epilepsy and had it controlled for several years with other medications. recently i was diagnosed with essential tremor and the doctor prescribed primidone. on the second day of use i had a seizure, as i continued usage and increased dosage as directed i started losing muscle control in my legs, i had periods where i thought i was losing my mind. i was unable to speak clearly as it felt like my tongue was swollen, but it was not. it got to the point where i could not stand up in the shower without leaning against the walls. my wife said get off that medicine! could not reach my doctor so i decreased dosage to zero. i take a lot of different medications for number of different medical problems, i think my brain had had it.	0
143809	i have gotten this implant about couple months ago bc i couldn't get the mirena. at first i had the depo shot and i actually like it better but i wanted something that lasted a little longer and a doctor told me to get it so i did. big mistake i did of getting it, when i had gotten it, it freaking hurt like my arm had hurt for like a while, then time passed i got bad acne and i really don't break out much but man it was bad, on top of that my hair was falling out like crazy my hair was getting thin a lot,on top of that i gained weight now, also the bleeding was annoying it wouldn't go away and before i got my period my ph balance was horrible i couldn't even have sex at all cause of the implant.	0
27760	i read so many scary things when i started lexapro for gad but i was so desperate to get my life back! i tried zoloft and it had a really bad effect on me. i switched to lexapro 10 mg after two weeks on the zoloft and it took a bit for the zoloft to leave my system (maybe a week)? after a couple weeks on lexapro 10 mg i went to 15 mg. after one week on 15 it was like a light switch went off in my head. all the anxiety is gone. i had a lot of start up side effects most notably increased anxiety, lack of appetite, waking up with panic attacks and just feeling like crap. but at that point where it kicked in, all that is gone. i feel better than i have in years!!! not the right med for everyone but give it a chance to see if it works for you.	1
17347	i have been taking toprol xl 100mg for at least 9 yrs, during that time i tried the metoprolol and it did not control my blood pressure, the toprol xl has worked great without side effects, however i have reduced my salt intake even to the extent of using red pepper on my eggs in the morning. i took it on myself to reduce my dosage of toprol xl cutting it in half because my pressure was checking much lower and i did so for about two week prior to a doctors appointment keeping a record of checks three to four times a day and gave it to my dr. and he ran a ekg, then reduced my dosage in half and i'm checking out fine at around 120/70/67 so suggest check your salt intake.	1
34864	only on my second week of treatment but its not looking so good. i got it to treat some cystic acne on my back and my skin cleared up quickly the first week. however i'm tired all of the time, and the cystic acne's coming back with a vengeance. just broke out with a line of huge pimples down my lower back which has never happened, and some on my face, all of which are very painful. i'll continue the treatment for a few more weeks but so far things aren't looking good.	0
162290	i just had my first injection both knees a few days ago. when i came home from the clinic, i ran down to the basement to get something and noticed right away my knees felt better. i had really bothersome aching in my knees at night, that is gone. so far, i am very impressed.	1
55650	this medication was by far the worst antidepressant have taken. the first month i seemed to do very well on it, after a year on it, i hit rock bottom mentally. it caused more terrible symptoms than what was beneficial to me. i had weird brain zaps that left me in bed for days, sleep disturbances, attention seeking behavior, as well as ocd that i had never experienced previously. it took forever to get off this terrible drug and i call it a terrible drug because your brain and body get physically addicted the way a street drug would, you miss 1 day and you start having severe withdrawals, sweats, extreme brain zaps, feeling out of touch w/reality/strange thoughts. after a month of being off effexor, all of the bad stuff stopped.	0
166067	i've had my iud going on 5 months. this is my first form of bc. insertion wasn't too bad, they had to straighten my cervix. apparently mine's angled - that hurt quite a bit but didn't last long. okay, the first about 3 months were hellish. i was bleeding off and on (not a lot) and intense pains. i think it was trying to expel itself but after those first 3 months of good and bad days i haven't had a bad day! no pains, i forget it's there. i would definitely recommend it. just hang in there for a few months of hormone weirdness and it's smooth sailing.	1
65557	never use it. it's just a lie. i ordered it once and they sent me the one which is almost out of date and it doesn't work at all. it just makes it worse. never ever by this product from a website. better take contact with doctor and get proper help. they are thieves who are selling this.	0
211937	i switched from depakote to lamictal after my first hospital stay. i'm currently taking 400mg lamictal and 75mg of effexor xr and i feel the most normal i have felt in my entire life. this drug has enabled me to go back to being the awesome person i always knew i could be. without my manic and depressive states, i am able to concentrate on my studies for the first time in my life and i've never felt better. the difference is night and day.	1
111670	this is the only medication that works for me!	1
231934	i was given it for insomnia while at a mental hospital. it did not help at all. it gave me really weird dreams and i could barely sleep so i was switched to ambien.	0
194160	this is my first time on any high blood pressure medication. my new primary care physician noticed that recently it's been high during my visits so he decided to put me on bystolic. the day he put be on this medication, (before i started it) i was driving to work in the morning and suffered what i can only assume a panic attack feels like (which is why i went to my doctor later that day). my heart was pounding through my chest, my face and arms went numb, chest pain and dizziness. anyway, i have been on it for less than a month and have seen no negative side effects yet and my bp has been normal. the only reason i didn't give this a 10 is because i have only been on it a short amount of time. we'll see if i get the same results over time.	1
112295	i was on vistaril, which worked for a while, but stopped working because with my ocd, i am terrified of taking med's that come in capsules. my doctor finally put me on gabapentin, and it works like a charm. the only side effect of note has been dry mouth, which is easily taken care of. i love this med.	1
197310	if you read the other reviews, they are all correct in saying you must never stop taking this medication suddenly. coming off this medicine was one of the most difficult things. you must do it very slowly and possibly add some other medications to ease the side effects. it's so important to have a good doctor to guide you.	0
23446	i am amazed at the effectiveness of methadone. i've spent the last three years in serious back pain due to a bad disc which ultimately led to back surgery. we tried everything under the sun. i can't believe how good i feel....no ups and downs, no weird &quot;highs&quot; (which i hated the most about pain medicines) and no more feeling like i'm losing my mind. i've never felt so strongly about posting a review before. i am ever grateful to the creators of this pain medicine.	1
228047	constant bleeding for 2 months on implanon. i was given the pill (marvelon) to stop the bleeding which worked. but soon after i got severe anxiety/depression/panic attacks, back pain. i was ill most of the time i had it in. always at doctors for something. it's now been removed 3 weeks ago and am seeing therapist because of this. i hope when i get my period back i will get back to normal. do not recommend this!	0
42187	was diagnosed with 'silent' gerd with erosive esophagus. put on omeprazole for a couple weeks, then got prescription dexilant for a couple weeks. both gave me daily very uncomfortable symptoms of heartburn that i had never had before. my doctor said i was his first &quot;failure&quot; on that medication.	0
156386	i am on 6mg of the 24hour release ropinirole and i think i've found the solution. i take 2mg in the afternoon then 4mg an hour before bed and after living with restless legs syndrome for 45 years driving me insane for many years i actually think i may have found the solution, highly recommended.	1
104488	i've been on lutera now for over two years and i love it! my doctor started me on yaz, which gave me cramps every day and made me extremely moody. after 3 months of yaz i switched to lutera and my crampiness and moodiness have been much improved ever since! i used to experience moderate to severe cramps the week before and during my period. i was also unable to exercise without taking advil. on lutera my cramps are much milder, only last about 2 days, and i can exercise without taking medicine. also, my period was highly irregular before lutera. now my period comes at the same time every month and lasts exactly five days. the only downside is that my sex drive is much lower on the pill. but i still recommend lutera for first-time users.	1
108921	i got the nexplanon within two months of having my son. i have now had it for two years and have had maybe one period which is great, but also kind of worries me what the long term health risks are with not having a period. no weight gain, no increase in acne. i will say though that it's basically killed my sex drive.	1
7405	holy hell.... the inside of my vagina is twitching with itching!!!!!!! what the hell happened to the ovule?! i've had no problem with the egg and now this shitty cream? no wonder they give you cooling wipes. it's like it's burning your vagina! this is terrible. i really hope this flushes everything out because your vagina is like the opposite of a toothpaste bottle. once it's in, you can't take it back. this sucks......	0
48487	i've been taking this pill for almost 6 months now after switching when my insurance no longer covered the birth control pill i had been taken previously. i decided to try this pill for quite a few months because i know side effects can subside after the first few months and i wanted to give it a real shot. unfortunately, after 23 years of minimal to no breakouts, this pill has given me extreme breakouts on my face, shoulders, and back. i've tried several types of skincare to control the breakouts to no avail. i have also suffered from anxiety and depression in the last few months, something i thought was work-related, but have decided this pill is no longer worth the risk. i will be switching pills starting next month.	0
176426	i have been taking ativan for a few days while i wait for lexapro to kick in. it has been a life saver. it has allowed me to eat and sleep, which has been huge in this fight against anxiety. it really helps mellow me out and take the edge off.	1
92551	i was rxed the odt for extreme nausea and vomiting, due to a norovirus. the minty flavor really drove me over the edge, and only made matters worse. then my doc gave me the regular tablets that you swallow with a tiny bit of water, but it didn't help at all, either. i remember being awed by the knowledge that they give this med to sick cancer patients, when it is so horribly ineffective. evidently, it does work like gangbusters for some people, but i'm not one of them.	0
170133	i'm 32 years old, bipolar, ocd tendencies. have been taking seroquel xr for over a week now. at first it seemed to trigger a manic episode that lasted for 5 days. for someone who typically spends most of his time on the depressive side, this was heaven. lol i take 100mg a day just before bed time, have no trouble getting to sleep, am able to stay asleep and don't find it too difficult to wake up. i normally have consuming and unwarranted anxiety. this has been greatly suppressed. i find it much easier to control my anger and in general my emotions have become much more stable. there have been no negative side-effects. i still feel like i need an additional anti-depressant as my normal &quot;base level&quot; is too low but am otherwise satisfied	1
81140	absolutely felt better in years. i have never used any medication prior to this so i was absolutely skeptical about my issue. this morning, i waited and waited for that steady drip down my armpit and it never came and it was only the first day i used it! i was absolutely ecstatic. now, i can wear clingy shirts and cute tops without ever worrying about there being a nasty stain or worse having someone see the sweat. btw, the stinging are only small side effects. neverthless, no pain no gain.	1
28455	i had extreme stomach pain within 1/2- 1 hour after taking lexapro. i ended up in the hospital, dosage was 20mg. i had taken lexapro a few years ago with no side effects. i have gained weight while on this.	0
96006	my boyfriend of a year started on zoloft 5 months ago, after trying many antidepressants. he totally lost his sex drive, and it changed his personality completely. he was no longer romantically interested in me and left me after 4 months on zoloft. we would only reconcile on days when he didn't take his medicines. he recently switched and i hope the new medicine is an improvement.	0
106875	i got implanon in on october 2013, after a month my cycle of period has become strange. starting off being light(spotting) for a week or two, then stopped. but after a while (a week) really heavy like soaking super tampon in 10 mins. that continued a day or two, then light again, lasting for more than 1-2 months at a time, stopping and starting of blood flow during a period. i also experienced cramping and bloating sometimes, started to gain weight after three month gained 5 kg in three month, some mood swing (but not too bad) i've got it removed of course.	0
209241	i take invega, 12mg/day, and it helps a lot with my difficulty concentrating and the depression. i'm actually able to live a normal life with it. unfortunately, it does not help with the hallucinations at all. so my doctor decided to try adding geodon. it made me have seizures and made the hallucinations much, much worse. they went from happening for a minute or so at a time, a couple of times an hour to being constant. i only took it for three days. two days after i stopped taking it, i was back to normal. the whole experience was miserable.	0
99451	the prep worked very well, the taste was horrid, and hard to keep down, after the am dose at 5, i was still going at 7:30 and had to wear a depends to get to the hospital, i had burns in my mouth, and although i used lots of a&amp;d, my backside was scalded, with in a week of using this, i developed psoriasis all over my body, i have been treated now for several months, which is expensive, doctors claim that it couldn't be because of the prep, although i have found two other senior women that have had the same results, i think this prep is expensive and dangerous, don't do it!!	0
107564	i have had the implanon for about a month now. the insertion didn't hurt and it was free with my insurance. i have actually had an increase in my sex drive, and my migraine headaches (which i was getting at least once a week) have now greatly reduced. i have some light bleeding, but i was warned of this before i got it inserted, and your doctor will inform you of side effects before you get it so you can't really get angry when it happens. i am a busy person and i chose this birth control because it suits my life style. overall i love it, and would highly recommend it to others.	1
116771	i've take so many medications throughout the years. there was always something i didn't like. i always felt off with every medication. i found out about st john's wort and it changed my life! zero side effects! if you're wondering about medications please give st john's wort a try! i feel like me, but a better me! not a &quot;medicated&quot; me	0
188018	great drug and works like a charm. the only problem i found is it depletes your magnesium and potassium and i got muscle cramps so bad i thought i was having a heart attack. even was rushed to hospital. the said, no heart attack. finally, i figured it out on my own eleminating things because all the doctors wanted to do was push more drugs on me. cannot take the drug. i have had part of my large colon removed due to diverticulitis and then gall bladder surgery as well as adhesion removal surgery. for those that are able to take it, i highly recommend it.	0
132419	truly a life saver. i take 1.0mg on an as needed basis. i like it that it doesn't give me a hang over and it is short acting for me- usually lasts 4 hours. klonopin works the same but is longer lasting and a little stronger.	1
131774	i had a major trauma happen in my life about 11 yrs ago. although i have been depressed for most of my life i went to the doctor for extra help during this stressful time. my doctor prescribed effexor xr and i was on 75 milligrams per day and then within the last 4 years to 150 milligrams. i truly do not know what i would do without this medicine. it really has improved my life, my mood and lessens the depression. i too once tried to wean off on my own and it was very emotional time. i will never do that again without my drs knowledge and help. effexor xr has changed my life and improved it greatly. i say try it and if it doesn't work for you, continue to consult with your dr to find a medicine that helps your depression. best wishes.	1
194681	i was taking linzess for the better part of three years it did the job but had major aes. i experienced bloating, weight gain and the biggest problem for me was stomach pains. my gi doc switched me over to trulance about 30 days ago and as of now not having any aes. i hope it continues to work this well.	1
30551	took the one day formula. once the ovule disintegrated, i started to experience the most painful itching and burning... i have a high pain tolerance but i&rsquo;m sitting here almost in tears experiencing this. can&rsquo;t believe i spent almost 20 bucks to feel this type of pain.	0
37797	i've been on reclipsen for about three years now with a brief time on amethia. i love reclipsen. i started taking it when i was 15. i have never experienced any negative side effects. the only things i have experienced are my breasts getting a little larger, a much lighter and shorter period, and improved acne. i will stick to this birth control probably until i decide to have kids and after. highly recommend this for young girls.	1
9501	this birth control pill caused me to have multiple blood clots in my lungs!!! very dangerous!! :( ladies beware!	0
7872	my anxiety is so much under control now.	1
190447	i was on this medicine for three months as my first time on birth control and ended up suffering from severe depression, making school and work very difficult. i returned almost completely to myself when i got off the medication and have no more negative thoughts. i didn't get pregnant though, so that's a plus.	0
47875	from the age of 10 i have suffered from terrible spots and acne. at age 15 i was at my worst. i had more acne than face! my gp prescribed me with the cream and after a few days i realised my spots were becoming alive and sore. the cream made my face dry and flaky. however two months into the treatment my face became almost fully clear and many people asked if i had skin surgery. this cream works wonders, however the initial few weeks are very horrible. overall, if you're getting treatment for acne get this cream! !	1
6962	please read: are you afraid of shaking people's hands? do pencils slip from your grip? have sweaty hands during the dead of winter? afraid of handling loose change? do you want a change? look no further than drysol! i've had all the above problems and more for so many years; i've been embarrassed and socially anxious because of hyperhydrosis. finally i went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist recommend drysol. i had never heard of it before, but what more could i lose? my actual hands? i tried it every night for 4 days now, and it keeps getting better and better. we went to church today (christmas) and during the peace offering my hands were completely dry! i owe my life to this product. god bless them. i recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!!	1
82976	my first anti-depressant/anxiety. removed any anxiety 95 times out of 100 but at the cost of no emotions within your daily life, basically a rock.	0
158203	because of this drug, i have the most stability i've ever had in my 23 years with bipolar. i also take lithium, lamictal and pristiq. lithium is a great stabilizer also but geodon is the cornerstone of my treatment. i suffered for 12 years before geodon. i was an ultra rapid cycler. i had a lot of people make fun of me during that time. now i'm married and i have achieved so much. one word of caution: do not drink diet mountain dew or any drinks or food with a flame retardant in it (brominated vegetable oil for example). these will cause an onset of tardive dyskinesia.	1
82204	my stomach always hurt and threw up and got the runs. would not recommend.	0
32285	please, mention what the pharmaceutical company your lisinopril is from! sometime over the last few months(?), lupin pharmaceutical has changed tablet sizes (i think in all dosages). my brother is on this medication, has been for 8 years. he hadn't really noticed the pill size change because he recently changed pharmacies also. within the last couple of months, he has had some symptoms that he wasn't sure why he was having. primarily, dizziness and lightheadedness, which has also stirred up his anxiety, and fluctuations in bp and heart rate (both going very low). he decreased dose, then stopped taking. then bp spiked. took lower dose again, and dizziness is back, anxiety is back. viscous cycle with little answers at this point.	0
20094	so i went in on tuesday for a uti but no bacteria showed up so the doc prescribed the generic macrobid and the first pill i took was on wednesday i ended up having a severe headache 30 minutes later and got a slight fever all day and took the 2nd pill. the next day i woke up feeling great and took the medicine again leaving me with a terrible headache again. so that night i did not want to take it what so ever. then friday came (today) and i went back in for a different medicine and my head didn't hurt really at all but i found out i still had a temp of 100.1. this pill has given me the worst with terrible headaches and a fever. definitely doesnt work with me. bdid slightly help whatever i have going on but not as quick as others	0
18698	i have been diagnosed by micro prolactinoma (4x9 mm) about a month ago. my prolactin levels were around 150 ng/ml. i started using cabergoline 0.25 mg twice a week. at the end of only one month, my prolactin levels dropped from 150 to 3 ng/ml. i have been told to use it for about 2 years to eventually shrink the tumor. the side effects were (especially in the first 2 weeks) nausea, extreme fatigue, and depression. i started on zoloft for the depression and it worked pretty well.	1
64051	i took zoloft consistently for about three months and it was the hardest three months of my life. it made my depression significantly worse. i thought if i stuck with it for a while it would eventually help me but it didn't. it did help with my anxiety though. as soon as i stopped taking any antidepressant my anxiety sky rocketed and i was able to beat my depression by finding god. i hope this helps whoever is reading this. stay strong.	0
124041	i've had skyla for over a year now. the insertion was fairly painful, some very intense cramping that lasted about 3 days. in the first month i gained 15 pounds (after remaining the same weight for over ten years now) which i have since lost. i no longer get my period but will have random spotting that has basically ruined all of my panties. also random extremely intense cramps that i never experienced while on oral birth control. my acne is worse now then it ever was in high school, but then again i was on oral contraceptives that whole time. lately i have noticed cramping and pressure during intercourse, which is worse during certain positions and has basically made me not want to have sex anymore.	0
177291	i took this drug for gad. of course it did its job. but please read about its withdrawal symptoms before starting!!! i have stopped taking it 4 days ago and you can't imagine the things i am going through. i remember before taking it, i read reviews about this drug. and one of the reviews wrote 'do not take this drug. it is hell' and i was like why so dramatic. and oh boy was he not!! i am reading about how to reduce the withdrawal symptoms. and after reading the users who are trying to stop cymbalta on this page https://www.drugs.com/answers/long-cymbalta-withdrawals-747877.html?page=2, i found out that i have a long way to go. please be careful.	0
51104	unfortunately, this is the second time i have had to endure this medication. the bottom line is, on each occasion the chlamydia infection has been treated. however, the process of getting there is nothing short of debilitating. i am not the type to complain and can take pain well but i cant stress this enough. do not take this and go to work!!!! i am currently sitting at my desk in agony, the abdominal pain is so extreme it has me bent over. i know from previous experiences this is likely to last for anywhere between 3-6 hours and only kicked in about 2 hours after first consumed. take with caution	0
117318	only think that has worked, and i have tried everything!!!!! saw results within a couple of weeks! i never write reviews but thought this is worth passing on to others!	1
13898	on insulin and bydueron 2 mg been on it 8 months been ok but last month severe vomiting diarrhea. i don't eat for 2-4 days at all now smell of food gives me projectile vomiting. i stopped today	0
229613	it's ok, i'm not suicidal anymore because of latuda. not too long ago i got off of pristiq and lamictal even tried getting off of vyvanse, everything went downhill from there, so my psych doc decided to put me on latuda. at first i felt restless at bedtime but now i feel super tired and sluggish, zombie like. also emotionless so i don't know if i will keep taking it. i want to feel again. right now i've not been feeling like myself. so we will see what the doctor says.	1
202598	i really hope this was going to work. my side affects were bad first a rash (very bad). many creams and strong prescriptions we're given with little to no help but the worst was the heart damage. i had a mild heart attack the doctor felt strongly it was due to this medication this is only my experience i do not want to discourage anybody that it can help just be careful of all the signs	0
207400	this stuff has 17 grams of sodium sulfate. grab a periodic table and do the math. the extreme sodium levels in this stuff skyrocketed my bp and could have killed me. it went to 230/132. do a search and you will find others who experienced this. no warning about elevated bp anywhere in the side-effects. really? no sodium content listed. a bag of chips requires that, but not potentially lethal drugs? something very wrong there.	0
173420	effectiveness, is slow with several applications. works for short period of time. afrin works longer and better, without the camphor smell and burn.	0
89761	i have been on this medication for just shy of 2 months. i was prescribed it for anxiety and depression, but mostly anxiety. i have found it to be good, however not so much for anxiety. it has helped my sleep for the most part, but i still get significant anxiety in the day time. i will say you have to give it a good month for it to show it's benefits, and there are side effects in the beginning, but they are minimal and not significant, mostly just yawning and sexual side effects. other then that i have found it to be effective.	1
223010	i was put on topamax for about 3 weeks for excruciating migraines that i would get just about daily. while it was pretty effective at decreasing my headaches (i only had about one or two in the three weeks i was on it), i experienced side effects from it. i was taken off it for a few days and then put back on to see if i still had the same problems. a little bit of lip tingling but nothing major. when i upped the dose like i was supposed to my gums started hurting so my doctor took me off it and put me on depakote.	0
71384	i've used this medication for months and it saved my life! i used to have the heaviest periods. i would bleed through my pants almost everyday of my period no matter how much i changed my pad/tampon. with this medicine i never even have to worry about my period anymore! i have experienced no side effects or down sides to this pill. i absolutely recommend it for anyone who had a troublesome period. i love it!	1
172377	i have had trouble sleeping for at least 10-12 years. my brain doesn't seem to shut down. otc like benadryl has no effect on me at all. after many trials, my doctor found than a combination of clonazepam and tranzadone work great for me. they two don't make me sleepy at all but instead calm down my brain activity in order to go to sleep. i take them about two hours before going to bed. in addition, i found that the brand name qualitest for clonazepam works better than teva. i've been using this combination for about three years and they work great.	1
50701	i have been taking this medication at a prescribed dose of 3200mg a day. i have now had to come off it as the side effects i have had were quite severe. vomiting, headaches, dizziness, lack of sleep, very moody to name a few.	0
210750	this medication only made me feel worse i took it for my anxiety and panic attacks and honestly it didn't help at all if anything made things worse. i put on about 10kg the hungers been horrible the weight gain makes me feel worse. at the start of taking it it stopped my ability to have panic attack so my anxiety would build to no release but now the panic attacks have come back and theyre worse. ineffective and horrible side effects	0
134477	good inflammation clear up rate on each use. eventually kept on and weaned off dropping 1 per week over several weeks. definite facial/body hair and fluid retention/roundness of face.	1
85173	took three months. bled a whole month straight during, like a medium-flow period. no signs of pregnancy or miscarriage hormones, doctors say. no growths to explain bleeding or abnormalities in my blood test results. i experienced little nausea/ headaches and no swelling.	1
120382	worst experience of my life by far! first off you can expect to have side affects 4-6 weeks after you last dose. i had to be put on anxiety medication because i became extremely distraught. i had night terrors thoughts of hurting myself and other even my dog. i managed to separate those thoughts from who i knew i was but the emotional impact is so real. i also became paranoid that i was someone i was not! best advice is first get on an anxiety medication so that you can deal with the daily thoughts. i'm not saying stay on it forever just while you wait out those weeks. other key thing is have somone you can call 24/7 and talk to about the thoughts that know how you are regularly. luckly i still have my mother.	0
217608	i have been on biaxin for 3 days now. i have very loose bowel movements, horrible taste in my mouth, and i can't sleep. i have been eating tootsie roll pops to combat the bad taste in my mouth. i am going to stop biaxin immediately and call my doctor first thing in the morning. up at 2:00 am now, wide awake with diarrhea and a tootsie roll pop!	0
225960	this drug has many unpleasant side effects.	0
162749	my 11 year old son got put on this drug for ear infection. he is allergic to amoxicillin, so they prescribed cefdinir. he took it one time before and had no issues. this time however on day 8 of 10, he broke out in severe hives all over his body. had to counteract with benadryl. took him to urgent care and they prescribed prednisalone for 5 days. on day 3 now and still have not seen any improvement. i am trying to be hopeful that by day 4 i will see some. has anyone had a similar experience?	0
75754	i was prescribed temazepam to replace my previous sleeper, i don't use anything very often. sometimes i have a period where i don't sleep so well, i tried 10mg the first night with zero effect then the following night doubled to 20mg also zero noticeable effect. i'm yet to try 30mg but i believe it may only be affective on some people.	0
225922	31 years old and have never taken any kind of medication other than birth control. recently went through some tough stuff and finally broke down after almost a year of feeling terrible and talked to my doctor. started taking wellbutrin about a month ago and i haven't felt this good in years. i started feeling better almost immediately. i am motivated and focused and like my old self again. in addition i stopped smoking completely about a week after i first started taking it. only negatives are i am having a really hard time getting enough sleep and the dry mouth is bad but only on occasion. i really hope that the insomnia gets better because although i feel great, i know it can't be good to have such little sleep long term.	1
201421	about 2 years ago i started experiencing the worst panic attacks of my life. i thought i was having a pulmonary embolism &amp; went to the emergency room twice. after blood work, ecgs, heart monitors and chest x-rays i finally accepted i was suffering from anxiety. i went to see my dr &amp; i've been on zoloft 50mg for approximately 10 months. the first 3 months on zoloft honestly were the worst months of my life. my anxiety was 10 times worst, i was experiencing horrible insomnia, dry mouth and a permanent yawn. the side effects have subsided and i'm so thankful to be anxiety free even though it took almost 4 months. i would definitely recommend zoloft and tell everyone to just stick out the first few months! good luck! you are not alone :)	1
9242	i'm taking this medicine for the past 3 months and i have to say its the worst!!!!! i feel very very sad, i started to get anxious and have meltdowns easily. i have no energy to do absolutely anything, not even cooking dinner or walk my dogs and i was an active person. i tried to stay on the pill because i thought that my body will get used to but i'm still having the same side effects. also a lot of stomach issues bloating, constipation, nauseas as well headaches at the right or left side of my head only. the only improved side effect i had noticed overtime is that when i started to take this medicine i had a lot of acne and skin inflammation but now i see my skin much better. this medicine has more cons than pros stay away!!!!	0
49422	i was taking aviane before and transferred my prescription to a different pharmacy. there they gave me lutera since they did not have aviane... worst experience of my life. constant headaches and acne were the main symptoms right before my period. extremely painful periods as well. if you are experiencing these symptoms while on lutera, i would highly recommend trying aviane. i do not have any headaches or acne and my periods are pain free.	0
157875	i had cystic acne and nothing worked until i finally tried accutane. it's truly a life saver! i had lost my confidence until i tried this product. only side effect was dry nose, dry yes and chapped lips. all of which is minor and worth the beautiful and flawless skin that follows! four years later and it's still the best and only thing that works! i tried it all...cortisone shots in the face, retin a, differin, facials, scrubs, proactive, blue light treatment etc.... nothing ever worked. do yourself a favor and get this as soon as possible. i was finally able to give up wearing foundation too.	1
103652	everyone is different but kapidex does nothing for me. i was on 60 mg for 2 weeks and am now on 120 mg. no side effects but then it doesn't help either. i had the same experience with prevacid so it probably should be expected. i hope it works for you but i would ask for samples before spending a lot of money on something that may not work.	0
34718	prescribed for acne, 50mg capsule once daily. had a few blemishes i couldn't get rid of and it helped clear up a few. experienced dizziness when first taking it then a couple days later developed small, red bumps on shoulders, it stayed that way and i really didn't see anything to worry about until the 6th day when i had a terrible swarm of symptoms occur that indicated a strong allergic reaction. i really didn't feel right when i first started taking it but no major symptoms to worry about, little did i know my body was having an allergic reaction for 6 days straight and then it became severe. i called my doctors office to let them know about the rash and they didn't contact me back in time to inform me that it was the start of an allergy	0
142674	i'm 18. got the mirena iud for prolonged heavy periods. i have been off and on of various forms of birth control for nearly 3-4 years trying to fix this problem. birth control was working, but i wanted something more permanent because i was tired of taking the pill everyday. i've had the iud since feb 28 and for the first few months my periods were everyday and heavy. now it's august 12 and i still get periods, but they are very light(pantyliner bearable). however i'm still concerned because i don't like the feeling of bleeding everyday, even if it is light. i'm not satisfied with mirena and at this point i'm not sure what to do about my period problems.	0
17292	i'm at the end of my 2nd month. first month was on the .25 dose. gained 4-5 pounds in the first 2 weeks! i'm very petite and have been the same weight for 20 years so this was a huge drawback. my dr. changed me to the .35 dose and still the same weight but now more pimples and bled for 2 weeks. also, i think this pill makes me feel kind of blah and empty inside. could be environmental factors but i think i'll be switching soon!	0
204045	i have palmar hyperhidrosis. when i used this, it didn't work for me at all. my sweat literally sweated off the medication. i used every night all summer long and got no results. i've been struggling for at least 3 years.	0
107902	put this on yesterday at 12:00pm on the right side of my hips, and my right leg subsequently felt funny ever since - like it was heavy and cramping, but i had chalked it up to my anxiety disorder playing tricks on me. then last night while changing my clothes i found a new bruise on that same leg that was giving me trouble. i called my prescriber and yanked the damn thing right off my skin. leg still feels funny but i have no other symptoms other than that since; but i was very tired, getting cramps, and would get hot flashes on and off. needless to say it's still a mystery with what's happening to me, but i've been scared off this bc for good.	0
31604	i feel like i'm dying right now! i want to cry and get all of this stuff out of me. it hurts so bad and i have no clue if i will sleep at all tonight.	0
66597	i used toviaz for 10 days and its side effects started to be unbearable. so i had to give it up.. maybe if i would continue to use, it could show its true effects but dry mouth and dizziness made me very bad..	0
149601	i've had my mirena for 5 weeks. i am 24 yo and childless. i was on the nuvaring before but i had gained some body fat in my lower abdominals and opted out of it. (i'm a fitness model) i had it inserted roughly two days before i was supposed to have my regular period. insertion was extremely painful, i cramped very bad and i fainted. i woke in a cold sweat. extremely nauseous, dizzy. i cramped off and on for about a week and had heavy bleeding for 9 days. it went away. occasionally after sex, i will cramp for a few seconds but nothing serious. i had a light period 4 weeks later for two days. (used to have heavy ones for 4-5 days). acne during period and some tender breasts. symptoms seem to be diminishing. will keep for the term!	1
170921	so far so good. i have been on remeron (30 mg) for 3 years. it stopped being effective almost a year ago. since then i have tried many other things. finally my doctor suggested seroquel (100 mg at bedtime), in addition to the remeron. i noticed the difference almost immediately -- within 24 hours. severe depression symptoms have eased off and also less anxiety. unlike others, i have had no grogginess with it so far. so, while its early in the game, seroquel looks to be good so far. will post update as my treatment time continues.	1
189706	oxycontin is the greatest pain killer ever made, i dislocated both my shoulders at the same time and was taken to er and sat there for 6 hours with both my shoulder out of socket. i was screaming so anyway after i was fixed a day later the right shoulder popped out again. so got that put in and they gave me 40mg oxycontin and it took the pain away for good.	1
43434	does very little to deal with my pain. i have both muscle and joint pain and it deals poorly with both.	0
194021	so far i am extremely impressed! after beginning birth control on reclipsen (the worst pill in the world) i began gildess because my friend used it and claimed she actually lost weight! so i gave it a try. weight loss did in fact occur. the junk food cravings that i had accumulated because of reclipsen subsided quickly and my appetite has gone way down. i only get hungry about once a day. my severe cystic back acne is gone. gone. it just vanished with this pill. my face cleared up a little as well and the overall texture of my skin is improved. softer, smaller pores, clearer. now the cons: nausea for the first 3 weeks. spotting for the first month. i'm a little more emotional but it's controllable. i really do recommend this pill.	1
179730	i was using epiduo for about four days then realized that my face began to burn like i was sticking my face into a fire. so i just ignored it the first day it began to burn and though that maybe it was the soap that i used to clean my face before i applied epiduo, so i used a different soap and applied the face cream and it began to burn even more than before. i then just decided to stop using epiduo and my face continued to burn two days later. i do not recommend for anyone. horrible experience.	0
184555	i get really bad panic attacks and suffer from panic disorder with agoraphobia. my doctor tries to steer away from benzos because of the addiction factor, which is understandable. however, vistaril has done nothing for me. it's as if i'm taking sugar pills. if i'm suffering from an exceptionally bad panic attack, i still have to be taken to the e.r. where they give me benzos anyway.	0
88541	this was my third colonoscopy and had never had problems before with other prep kits. this one did me in. i woke up the day of the procedure feeling queasy, and sure enough, about 40 minutes after drinking the prep, i was vomiting profusely. i had to run the drug store to get magnesium citrate to complete the process, but got sick after that as well. luckily, i kept the latter down long enough to get the necessary affect. my gastro was not happy that i'd had the problem. he apologized profusely and said that was the last one he was prescribing. too many patients were reporting problems.	0
181196	14 days on 20mg. i am edgy and wobbly, no appetite, forced myself to eat, so i am eating less. taking advantage of that because i am also a diabetic and hard to go to sleep. i am sticking with the medicine. have some relief of bad thoughts. hope it gets better.	0
212440	i've been on lamictal for a couple of months now, only up to 100mg, but i just stopped taking it due to the severe headaches i've been getting from it. just a heads-up as one of the potential side effects.	0
139927	my knees were in so much pain that my doctor recommended me have euflexxa shots in both of my knees. i had my last injection, number 3, on june 16th and i have no improvement in my knees. this was very costly which i really could not afford and my knees are in just as much pain now as they were before i had the injections.	0
175012	after 5 yrs gilenya is no longer working for me	0
33754	i was diagnosed with pcos when i was 16 - i'm now about 25. nine years of being on the pill, i've tried a number of different scripts. juleber was fabulous (was on it for about two years), but before leaving to study abroad, i was accidentally prescribed junel fe instead. good grief. i am miserable! like many other reviewers noted, i'm crying at random, i'm randomly hit with bouts of incredible sadness/depression, especially at night or later in the day. i'm anxious out of my mind, having panic attacks. i feel like a crazy person, not myself at all. i'm utterly horrified that this pill is being prescribed to anyone. going to the doctor locally tomorrow to fix this mess - ladies, stay away from this garbage pill.	0
119264	had low testosterone. i was in a car accident and had a head injury. this caused my pituitary gland to stop working and shrank from the pressure in my brain. i didn't want a patch. i inject every 2 weeks and it works great. it's much cheaper, nobody has to know unless you tell them and it takes 5 minutes every 2 weeks. what could be easier.	1
186649	wow what a difference maker. i am a young male (30ish) and have found that vyvanse has been such a life changer. i am gettiing so much more done at work. when i go home at night i find myself enjoying my time with my children more. i am not getting the crash effect i was experiencing with other medicines. that reason alone is so worth it. i have not had any side effects, well maybe minor dry mouth, but it last me 12-13 hours. it is truly an awesome medication. i would recommend it.	1
113755	i developed a tumor 6 yrs ago because of a temporary lack of oxygen and since then i have suffered severe, debilitating migraines that last for days. i've been through several neurologists trying to get help and have been on very strong medications that mess with my brain chemistry to little alleviating effect. the neurologist i currently have began giving me nerve block injections in nerve bundles near the base of my skull every few months. they are very painful &amp; only last about 8 weeks, sometimes longer if i'm lucky. during my last round he gave me fioricet to try to prolong the time between shots. i have to say it works wonders. i only take 1 and can actually function. if it returns i simply take another! that's all i need for weeks, at times.	1
212145	for years i have been misdiagnosed. i have been on cymbalta, seroquel, celexa, xanax, olanzaprine, vyvanse, and many other drugs i can't remember the names of. then i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. after multiple medications my doctor put me on lamictal. at 25mg i could tell that i was feeling better but i was still experiencing depression and hypomania. after two weeks i increased to 50mg and started to notice a big difference. my moods were more stable and i could function normally. although lethargy is still a problem but nothing coffee can't cure! now i'm on 100mg and although i'm still tired, i feel much better. this has saved my life and my relationships!!	1
83595	i started using this right after starting immune therapy for indoor and outdoor (perennial) allergies. i had been on zyrtec and the additional dose of allergans coming from the shots made me miserable with continual sinus mucus draining/blowing; i tried taking benadryl (on top of the zyrtec) but that put me to sleep. the xyzal stopped the allergic reaction, so i'm on it now for the second month with no side effects; and very happy to have it.	1
19390	i went from 800 mg of neurontin a day, with its zombie-like side effects, to 100 mg of lyrica with no side effects and more effective that neurontin.	1
108172	i like it so far other than having a rash from the patch. i also been itching. i'm on my 3rd patch and i vomited today	1
77430	after two shots, had swelling in both elbows, stiff neck and pain. i am not sure prolia is the cause but i will not risk it again or any drugs for osteoporosis. my immune system was compromised too and i have had several illnesses. i went from an active fit person to not being able to perform simple everyday tasks without big pain. i have had the worst 6 months of my life. avoid this medication!	0
212951	i found this to be a wonderful muscle relaxant with very few, if any, negative side effects. it worked well for me during many bouts of chronic back pain that kept me awake at night. it did make me a little bit sleepy and dizzy, but nothing that bothered me very much at all. at night, this wasn't even a concern, but i could easily take it during the day at work and perform and feel fine. this isn't exactly a &quot;pain&quot; medication but i did find that it worked almost as well for my particular back pain as the narcotic medicines i was also prescribed.	1
205014	great for dental pain. toradol was better than the narcotics prescribed (lortab) for managing the pain.	1
156959	please, please read this before trying any prescription for chronic constipation due to opioid use. due to a back injury, i have been taking opioids for over 10 years. i had chronic constipation with no relief with anything. then i read another person's experience with magnesium. the type of magnesium you take is important. you want to take one that has low absorption, so that it will pass right through. i went from having a bowel movement once a week or week and a half to having one daily. i take 1-250mg magnesium oxide and 1 docusate sodium (non-stimulant stool softener) twice a day (same dosage for the last 9 years). you can find these over-the-counter in any drugstore. unfortunately, a physician won't tell you this.	0
30727	i'd rather die that feel this burning and itching the suppository caused me wow but it did pretty much cure it after the first day.. doing night two just to make sure it's all gone	0
114292	i am using these to quit vaping. i cannot believe how effective they are! i barely even think about vaping. i smoked heavily for 10 years, and vaped heavily for 5 years. i still have that muscle memory of wanting to pick up my mod and it not being there, or getting ready to leave the house and not having to grab it. those things you can't help, but i have almost zero cravings. when i do it's because of triggers like after eating and when driving and it passes quickly. i tried the gum and for me it didn't work at all like not even a little bit. i would recommend nicoderm to anyone that's ready to quit!	1
182762	so far, so good. i haven't been on it very long but i definitely feel like my overall quality of life has improved. mild headache and nausea the first week or two, which went away. i still get sad, when sad things happen, but it no longer feels overwhelming. the &quot;doom and gloom&quot; is definitely gone. i take 2 a day, in the morning.	1
51537	i don't know why i've continued to use this, for what seems like years. i stayed with the 5% gel. while it's worked very well keeping breakouts at bay and my shoulders and chest, it has been not good for my face. i just keep getting pimples and excessive oil saturation. i very recently was upped to the 7.5% and that seems worse. i think it just is too harsh or just not effective for my face. i tried just using it every other day, but it seems the morning after i've used it, there are new pimples.	0
97852	i've been diagnosed with pcos amd currently proud mamma of a 18 month old son but not because of bc. before i had my son i used a few methods and the pill was the worse but only because i'd forget to take it. now after having him all bc has made me sick. except nexplanon. it's been 6 months now, and i'm happy. everything is the same. sex drive and all. however, i'm noticing mood swings. more frequent and a little more hostile but i snap out of it quick. also, im starting to mildly break out and my skin has been dryer but the drynrss could be weather change. no weight gain. weight loss at first but 15 pounds was all but after beginning my new serious relationship we kinda junk (food) out and do the wine and dine. 2 thumbs way up.	1
215576	after two months of sexual activity with a paraguard iud in place, my girlfriend is pregnant, and faces greater risk of health complications than a pregnancy without one.	0
210265	i did not have a pleasant experience on linzess. every time i took one dose of this medication, 20 minutes later i was flushed, light headed and extremely nauseous followed by an aggressive and painful bowel movement. would not recommend.	0
119597	i am 60 yrs old. i have been on androgel for just almost 3 weeks. i went to my doctor in september sharing that i have no energy sex desire for years, and felt worthless. my doctor did numerous blood test including on for testosterone. it came back at 140. i had no idea there was a problem. my doctor suggested the shots every two weeks but said that they can wear off well before my next visit. suggested androgel 0.5 in a pump rubbed on daily. it works. i haven't felt this good and full of energy in 15 to 20 years. the only side effect i have experienced at this point is that my testicles, which were the size of advocado seeds, are now about the size of pistachios and are a bit tender at times. i follow the directions exactly and apply after shower.	1
208922	i am a mental heath professional that wanted to switch from ambien to belsomra 15 mg. what a nightmare!! this drug shouldn't be on the market. read feedback from others. i had nightmare all night was being murdered by serial killer and was could not move or wake myself up. horrible. took it 10 nights. no sleep, just horrible dreams. read prior reviews.	0
136703	bone on bone both knees. retired rn 68 12hour shifts for 21 years really hard on the knees. walked in to orthopedic unable to put any weight on right leg without pain. after first injection pain was gone. got #2 and #3 a week apart. no pain for two years!	1
53464	after trying every other hormone. the doctor put me on methyltestosterone f s. i have been on this drug for 20 yrs now. my insurance will not pay for it.it is the only hormone that works for me. i type this now because i stop taking 10 days a go thinking 70 years old i would not need them. at this time i am in hot flashs, sweats and can not sleep. i will be making a appointment with my doc asap. do not think your to old to need estrogens and testosterones.	1
94177	brintelix made me feel angry and created very bad muscle tension my shoulders and arms. i've only been on it for two months. went to an accupuncurist who immediately told me that it is one of the side effects of brintelix. trying to get off it as soon as possible.	0
108605	i had good results with this in using it for 1 month as directed. i found it easy to use. i didn't experience any negatives like others mentioned. the only problem was the cost. $95.00 a month and that's with insurance. i asked my doctor if there is anything cheaper and she told me to used crisco 2x a week and yuvafem once a week. i have and it works! i have not experienced pain during intercourse and i cut the cost of using yuvafem in half. it sounds weird, but i thought it was worth sharing.	1
155098	i too have had a horrible experience with this medication. by my 4th dose i am extremely naseous, my body feels exhausted beyond compare and i feel like i am going to collapse at any moment. have no appetite, horrible acid reflux, and no will to get up out of the bed. i was going to try to commit to the full dose of 500mg 2x a day for 7 days, but i've had enough and can't handle these symptoms any longer! throwing this script in the trash and never taking this poison again!	0
63055	i experienced abnormal heavy bleeding for 4 weeks, was anemic and in danger of needing a transfusion. i took lysteda, as prescribed, for 5 days. it slowed my bleeding and i was able to sleep through the night without getting up to take care of overflow, allowing much needed rest. after 5 days, my bleeding stopped entirely. doctors are still looking for the cause of my abnormal bleeding, but lysteda has addressed the crisis and is giving me a reprieve from heavy blood loss. i'm grateful.	1
54216	within one hour of my first ever does (25 mg), i was in agony. sure, i pooped but then, i kept on and for hours (total four). in that entire time, i had the most severe intestinal pain i've ever had! bent over, screaming, clutching a pillow hard against my gut, i was repeatedly having watery brown smelly feces fill the adult diaper and run down my legs!! am now in hour four, it's less than it was. comes in waves. is there no antidote? no way to make it stop???? the pain is making me short of breath. my neck and lower back muscles are like tightened ropes. when will this end???	0
28478	had horrible anxiety upon waking up for the first two months. but it took lexapro (15mg) 3 months before i got the full effect and am much better now! dr also prescribed seroquel to speed things up. give this medicine time, it takes longer than the average 4-6 weeks as stated. i felt a difference within a few days.	1
207137	i've been taking toviaz 8mg for the past 3 weeks and it's been a life saver for me. not being able to control urinating had been getting worse and worse over the past 3 yrs. i was given a 2 week sample of the 8mg after i had a urodynamic study done. it found that my bladder functioned perfectly normal - no spasms. the next day i didn't make it into work, i had to go home and clean up/change clothes. so, i've been taking the toviaz since that day and bam the sudden urges are gone! i do have the chronic dry mouth and mild tiredness and found that taking it during the day verses at night was the better solution. waking up with cotton mouth in the middle of the night was a big problem. i suggest trying it, it's worth it!	1
216602	immediate relief! i was diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer 14 months ago. a few months of antacids and it healed, but all of my symptoms recurred 4 months ago. my gastro said i had gastritis and gave me antacids again but they didn't do much at all: still burping all the time (waking 3-4 times/night to burp myself like a baby), stomach tenderness from swelling, faux hunger pangs, nausea. the very first sucralfate pill stopped all of that. i take it 3x/day an hour before meals, which is my prescription for the next 3 months. also: i have an eating disorder that was constantly triggered by the fake feeling of hunger from my sore stomach. since starting on this medication, my disorder is easier to manage.	1
82849	a miracle drug for me after taking this med it gave.me the courage and strength to get up and do things it made me see things in a different way..ive been off and on with this med for four years now its the only antidepressant that works for me my anxiety completely went away and i feel like i can go threw with thing called life..	1
58633	it's great for trigeminal neuralgia pain. aside from forgetting words and not being able to spell and weakness, the side effects are not too terrible. it is much better than the tn pain.	1
148889	i had mirena inserted sept 23 2015. i have given birth full term 7 times, and the discomfort for me was definitely comparative! i wanted mirena so i could have sex without worrying about another pregnancy, but due to bleeding heavily for 3 out of every 4 weeks (to date it is now january 1, 2016) i have not even had sex because of the mess! i even have some spotting during the &quot;week off&quot;!! i always had regular periods with 7 days of heavy bleeding, i'll be happy to go back to that. i haven't gained weight from it, but i fluctuate about 5-8 lbs from week to week. my hair was already thinning, but that seems worse, the texture of my hair is more fragile.	0
104080	i've had no negative side effects. been on it for two months. no acne, i lost weight and my sex drive shot through the roof!! no pregnancies. only thing is my periods are a bit heavier and more cramps. but it only lasts four days.	1
14741	been on the pill for about 9 months. only the first month had side effects. since then, my mental health has finally stabilized. i have had severely unstable moods since i was 9. i also had premenstural dysphoric disorder and extreme cramping. since taking the pill, my whole life has improved and i'm able to accomplish things such as going to a regular school full time. now my period only lasts 3 days, and my sex drive is still there :).	1
154422	i have not missed a day of treatment and have not seen any change in my nail. i have one more refill to go, so remain hopeful but doubtful i will see any change.	0
192209	i used yaz for years with no problems but gianvi made me moody, depressed, and seriously suicidal. once i made the connection that my depression and suicidal thoughts were from the pill, i stopped immediately. sure enough, two days later, i felt cheerful and fine. i also noticed this pill gave me zero sex drive--so maybe it is really effective birth control.	0
66566	the only good side was that it helped me sleep good. but couldn't even get up in the morning i was so drowsy still and felt hung over bad also i was very lethargic. like numb and i felt numb. like crap almost like seriously depressed without depression state of mind horrible.	0
81184	i'm 42 years old i was given generic birth control for yaz not to prevent pregnancy but to help me with my hotflashes and irregular periods. i was on for 1 year &amp; 1/2 years and i notice i was developing muscle leg cramping , red spider veins on my legs. i read how it could be dangerous if you develop blood clot because of birthcontrol i discontinue the use but now i'm back of hotflashes no leg cramping but hotflashing are very uncomfortable i get moody any one knows what i can use to help me with hotflashes ..please help	0
192747	i got on yaz because my doctor says it helps with premenstrual syndrome, plus i've always had terrible heavy periods. it has cut them down significantly and helps with the premenstrual symptoms. my spouse also claims it makes me less crappy at the pms time. no bad side effects other than a hormone headache, but i used to get that anyway. the timeframe just changed.	1
161115	this has been a miracle drug for me and my wife, it has brought a balance between us that has never been there. she can tell when i am not taking it right away within hours of missing a dose, it is truly a life saver. the clarity it brought has given me a whole new lease on life.	1
57014	i have had an issue with gerd every night. i would lose sleep from the constant stomach pains and nausea. i would have to make myself vomit to feel even some relief. i finally got some help from my doctor and a little pill and now i feel awesome! it may be a little hard to swallow at first, but i have never felt better!	1
175488	took augmentin for severe sinusitis, after 2 hours started vomiting it would not stop, rushed to medical centre, given an injection to stop the vomiting didn't work, vomiting continued until only bile and blood was coming out, then given zofran wafers finally the vomiting subsided, but the stomach and chest pain continued all night. worst experience :(	0
152810	this shot is only given at a medical facility urgent clinic or hospital wait time after given is approximately 20 minutes to make sure there's no allergic reaction ... within a few hours my cough was slowed down	1
92962	i've been depressed for about 14 years. i was on wellbutrin along with cymbalta. i was doing weli, but sleeping a lot. my np suggested trintellix. she weaned me off of cymbalta and started me on 5 mg of trintellix for a week, then upped to 10 for 2 weeks, then started on 20mg. i immediately started having terrible mood swings, with anger and irritability. i have since gone back to 10 mg, however, i cry at the drop of a hat, i have no energy, i have muscle aches and i have a terrible neck ache. my anxiety level has been thru the roof and i have no appetite. i believe this medication has also given me diarrhea. this medication is horrible.	0
88473	i have been on adderall, 10mg twice per day, for about 2 months now. i am a 32 year old male, and i went to see my doctor because i was having an incredibly difficult time focusing and &quot;locking in&quot; on conversations at work. it was becoming a real problem. i went to previous doctors when i was in high school and college. i told them my concern about my inability to focus. they said i was depressed. but, i wasn't depressed and i knew i wasn't. finally, someone really listened and adderall and adult add was their diagnosis. it has been a miracle for me. i finally know what it is like to be alert and alive.	1
36602	i have ben on fentanyl for more than three years now with great success, no major problems or side effects. although about three months ago i started having some real bad side affects from the drug. after about 24-36 hours of putting on the patch i would start to get pain, agitation,sick feeling all over my body, fatigue, restlessness, very tired, neck and back muscular pain and bad headaches as well as confusion and the sweats etc.. all the classic symptoms of the patch not working properly. i am in the process of talking with my doctor about rectifying the problem with my dosage and time frame on how often to change the patch. if i knew how bad the feeling was to withdraw from this drug was i would have never taken it.	1
71526	i react different than others on most meds. i took vraylar for 4 days it helped with my moods but the side effects out weighed the good to it. it made me sick to my stomach, couldn't drive, had to sleep throughout the whole day, hot flashes, dehydration. it was horrible and i couldn't handle how bad it made me feel.	0
213512	omg! it burns so bad! it&rsquo;s the worst product ever. usually go to the doctor but my ph was off due to soap and felt this would be easier and save me some time. don&rsquo;t do it! now have to go to urgent care and trying to figure out how to push this out of me. it hurts so bad.	0
182768	i was placed on cymbalta for depression in 2006 worked generally for the most part for the depression then in 08 or 09 i found out that they were prescribing it for fm which i do have fm &amp; cymbalta did absolutely nothing for pain i've had no side effects from the drug at all none. in my research for new ssri i came across savella which is designed for fm &amp; i did a less than 30 days switch over from cymbalta to savella with 0 adverse effects or side effects( this medicine is working both for the depression &amp; the fm.) i am also taking oxycodone 2/10mg every 4hrs (in a 24 tyme frame)-12 pills a day. i'm also taking flexeril 10 mg 3x a day &amp; ibuprofen 800 mg 3x a day, &amp; tylenol i don't take the tylenol because of the deaths that occurred!	0
25488	i am in my 40's and take 1.25 mg a day for hair loss. it seems to be working. my hair feel thicker and looks fuller. however, it has also reduced my sex drive and amount of ejaculation.	1
174714	i have eczema that flares up awful with the season changes. this time it decided to flare up on my eyelids of all places and i was given eucrisa to help manage it. the medicine works and clears up my eczema dramatically. the burning is terrible! it is almost unbearable and hurts so bad it makes my head ache. so really it's just depending on where your eczema is located? i will keep using it because my eczema is awful without it, but goodness it is so painful.	1
176874	i have hg, and i've thrown up almost every hour in the hour. i was hospitalized twice before they finally gave my promethazine. i wasn't able to keep down the oral medication but i opted finally for the suppositories, and while it takes about 30 minutes for me to feel completely better, it's truly a life saver.	1
147280	i personally get more results with 1 mg. i've been using these for 5 years to treat my anxiety.	1
111582	i'm a 25 year old woman and i was prescribed cipro for a uti. i got 250mg twice daily for three days. i got this yesterday and today i've taken three pills in total. i have a horrid fear of vomiting, i become suicidal when i think i'm going to be sick. so i'm very particular and paranoid about my antibiotics. i usually respond well to antibiotics but not this! i didn't vomit, thank goodness but three pills in and i'm lightheaded, light sensitive, bloated like no other, abdominal pain and kinda nauseous, itchy and muscle pain. not to mention my anxiety is sky high! i'm writing this before my current panic attack makes me unable to write. hope these side effects leave and don't stay! very paranoid!	0
78634	did not finish the bottle because i immediately felt the urge. had a lot of cramps but listened to music to get my mind off of it. started around 6:30pm kept getting up to use restroom. felt good after two hours. give yourself enough time. definitely worth it!	1
187194	do not take this spray. i experienced 2 weeks of hell. massively increased anxiety and panic attacks, depression, blurred vision, headaches, fatigue, restlessness. i though i was going crazy! i put it down to the anxiety and thought i was just having a relapse. turns out, it was the steroids in the spray. 1 week off it and my eyesight is slowly returning to normal but still have the anxiety and killer sinus pain. not recommended.	0
86286	i drank down my suprep in about 10 mins, trying to just get it down in one shot (and i thought i was supposed to drink it kind of fast, not sure about that). drank down my next 32oz of water, and felt like a innertube i was so bloated. i was worried it wasn't working, because i've heard the stories of the sounds and gurgles and my stomach was just distended. but then.....i felt a little feeling that made me worry tremendously if i were to even coughed too hard. i hightailed it to the bathroom with the bidet (over the toilet, no need to move), and holy cannoli. i was there for literally (yes, literally) one hour. then i was able to take a shower and so far so good. 2am is the next dose, and i'm sure nothing will be left!	1
39372	this med has made me feel sick from the first day i started, i was hoping the side effects would become less as time went by, however i can't not stand the way i feel, so i am done!	0
75352	really helped with anxiety at night and getting a good nights sleep, also seems to have cleared up cluster headaches i have had for years!	1
207278	such a great pill! i contracted hsv 2 when i was only 17 by my boyfriend that cheated on me. one week before my highschool graduation. i started taking it only when having outbreaks until shortly after i was having 3-4 a month. i was beyond depressed. my doctor told me about suppressive medicine taking it twice a day (500mg) and ever since then i have been clear of any sign of an outbreak. i'm going on month 5 with no symptoms. makes me feel myself again! remember always use protection!	1
59201	this one is the best one i have taken. i had started with a different kind and it made me so sick. with this i have no problems.	1
111997	this stuff is garbage. if you have real pain, you might as well take aspirin instead of this. this stuff probably works great for those other nerve pain ailments like fibromyalgia and the like but don't expected it to do anything for other types of chronic pain.	0
52297	i have been on it for about a month on and off and lost 20 pounds. i didn't excercise at first, but have made it to the gym everyday this past week. it makes you aware of what you eat and how much you eat. i put myself on a strict eating plan of all fruits, veggies, and lean meats. i have 3 friends who have taken it and it has changed their lives! it is a miracle pill! i noticed in the beginning i would wake up multiple times a night (but would always have maximum energy all day) so i took a benadryl at night and it fixed it until i forgot to take it, and i realized i sleep all night without it now! it has helped me, and for me i don't consider it a quick fix because i'm more aware of what i consume. just 40pds more to go for me!	1
147904	this is a great pill it stops the bleeding but does give you a regular period every twenty eight days. the only con is that my breast get real tender and swell.	1
29734	this did not help my trigeminal neuralgia at all even at high doses. it had helped me in the past for neuropathic pain in my neck, so i was surprised but then, trigeminal neuralgia was a surprise. the side effects of high doses of topamax for me were serious cognitive issues hence, no help - bad side effects. i did find other medicines in combination that work - nortriptiline, trileptol and gabapentin.	0
72806	i have been taking birth control for 10 years due to surgery at a young age. i can honestly say that junel almost ruined my life. i became completely depressed on this medication, but blamed that on the fact that i just moved 1,000 miles from home and i was homesick. then i started to realize that there was a pattern. i'd get extremely anxious and depressed for a few days and then it would subside (somewhat) for a week or two. it got to the point where my anxiety was so bad i could barely breathe and making it through a day seemed impossible. i talked to my gynecologist and had my pill changed. i am a completely different person now and thankfully got off of this medication before it claimed my life.	0
163237	i have been on rythmol sr for two years. take 425 mg twice a day along with topral and warfarin. i am now feeling great, rarely have atrial fibrillation episodes. i no longer have the squeezing tennis ball feeling and chest throbbing at night, so i sleep better. i have observed no unwanted reactions. i am 77 years old.	1
38088	it just did not work for me. so are many others that i have tried in the last 8 months. i do think it's just me because after all is said and done, only calcium channel blockers with their side effects seem to work for me. i am now back to ccb (from norvasc and nifedipine) and now cardizem. norvasc i used for about 15 years and when it stopped working well, i tried other types like arbs, ace inhibitors, beta blockers, etc without much help. then i tried nifedipine which worked but with bad side effects the worst of which was serious edema that left my leg's skin exfoliating when i stopped taking it. i hope cardizem which already shows promise does not give me edema and other serious ccb side effects.	0
10187	feel better after two weeks but the smell is objectionable. takes multiple washings to remove from clothes. my wife has allergies to scents and the odor gives her a headache. she also feels aggressive just from the aroma. i have been extremely careful about avoiding contamination. one of our cats even goes nuts smelling my tee shirt.	0
202789	it does fix the problem, but i get heavy abdominal pains.	0
8247	i've always had issues falling asleep so i started taking this pill a couple months or a year ago. the first month or two it helped me fall asleep and wake up early - simple as that, no problems. after a while i started to build up a tolerance (i guess) and i couldn't really fall asleep when i took it. if i unintentionally stayed up for more than ~3 hours after i took the pill i would start getting weird side effects. like i felt like i was going crazy. the worst was when i was trying to sleep it felt like 'ghost' hands were touching my body or something...crazy...i know. in addition, i would find my self looking at weird shit on the internet, or thinking strange thoughts. most of the time i took the pill i would have gaps in my memory.	0
194373	took rosvastatin (crestor generic) 10mg for 3 mos. had knee pain, developed severe headaches, increased ringing and buzzing in ears. makes me concerned about taking any statins again ever. decreased ldl but too strong. noted my blood sugar was increased above the usual. so watch for that in your lab tests as it may be linked to this or other lipid medication.	0
101860	i took this medication for 90 days and experienced some side effects. the main one was fatigue and slight brain fog. to mitigate this effect i would take it before bed. i also had a dull ache the would come and go near my liver, but my liver test came back fine. another effect was that it made me slightly more agitated and anxious. i experienced no taste loss as others have experienced though. it seems like new nails are growing in nicely, but it remains to be seen if all of the infected nail will grow out. best of luck to anyone who gives it a shot.	1
186372	while pristiq does work great. i wish my doctor would have warned me about how hard it would be to get off of this medicine. i am in my mid 20's and my doctor was aware that i wanted to get pregnant in the future. i have had issues with seasonal depression and taken different anti-depressants for a 5-6 months in the past. pristiq has been a nightmare to get off of. i have reduced the dosage as my doctor has said so that i can get pregnant in the future. but i have had horrible vomiting episodes, confusion, brain zaps, terrible muscle pain, sharp shooting pain throughout my body. feeling disconnected. i still have not been able to get off this medicine. i wish you all the best.	0
49538	i've been on this pill for a month and a half since planned parenthood switched me from reclipsen. i've never had any side effects from my pills that i've used, i started with diane when i was 18 because i had severe acne and it went away with the pills like two weeks after i started! so happy i did that. after that they switched me to jasmine which was fine, then reclipsen which was fine and then chateal. i've had two side effects with this pill so far, nausea and headaches. it hasn't been that bad though and i hope they go away. i feel like if you have a lot sideffects with pills, you will have them with all pills, and you should choose another method. this is the birthcontrol that is for me but not for everyone!	1
94746	when i was younger i was put on abilify in combination with antidepressants. i've been off of it for about 5 years or so now. as i recall it didn't do much for me, however my weight skyrocketed during the time i was on it, and it stuck with me even after i was off of it. at my worst i was about 250 pounds. i've lost a lot of weight since then, however, i still struggle with my weight today which creates a self-esteem issue that adds to my depression.	0
125296	i took 2 pills at 6 pm right after supper and by 3:30am i woke up to excruciating abdominal pain. i went to the bathroom and could not sit upright on the toilet. i sat there for about 15 mins and had a bowel movement. i crawled back on the bed and almost passed out. i was sweating so bad and cold chills. i'm jerking all my clothes off laying naked. i was hurting so bad. i moaned and rolled on the bed from the pain. it's 7:35pm the next day, been over 24 hours since taking the medicine and i'm still cramping. i've had 6 bowel movements so far. i thought maybe my body just couldn't handle laxatives but reading other reviews it could possibly be the product. never again will i take a laxative.	0
40382	have had fm for a few years now and have tried every medicine out there then my doctor suggested this new medicine &quot;savella&quot;. i got my prescription on a friday and the next day i was ready to go back to my old medication (suboxone) i was a zombie! i literally slept the whole weekend and couldn't get up! so i'm back on suboxone out of (lyrica, tramadol, cymbalta, percocet, vicodin, darvocet, nsaids, muscle relaxers, neurontin, etc, etc, etc..) suboxone is the only one that helped with the pain up to 75%! good luck to all of you with fibromyalgia...a lot of people do not understand the constant pain and everything else associated with fm. i do understand so i wish you luck!	0
180190	my co-worker (who is also pregnant) suggested that i ask my doctor to prescribe diclegis for me if i ever experienced nausea at any point in my pregnancy. i was sure i wasn't going to experience any of that until i hit week 7 &amp; oh! i was in for a rude awakening. my nausea became horrible from day to day until i asked my doctor to prescribe something for my nausea. of course, diclegis was the medicine prescribed. after taking two at bed-time the first night, i didn't feel at all nauseated the next morning, therefore i didn't feel the need to take the morning dose. now, only if i feel nauseated in the morning time, i'll take my morning dose (1tablet) and continue on with my day. the only downside? diclegis can cause drowsiness.	1
74303	i was on loestrin 24 for 6 months. no mood swings or side effects, but i just switched because my breakthrough bleeding got bad. i would have spotting off and on and then i was having a period the week before my brown pills. my doctor said this level of estrogen was too low for my body, but otherwise i think it was fine.	0
231213	i kept this cough syrup even though it was five years old. took it to stop an uncontrollable cough and boy did it work! i was able to sleep soundly, better than ever. woke up and did not feel like moving much. i would not take this if i had to go to work in the day. i only took one teaspoon and have done it for two nights.	1
229361	today is day 3 on latuda. first night i had to take a xanax to go to sleep, day 2 i fell asleep in my own. tonight i still have no symptoms. i'm feeling better after 3 days. i am highly sensitive to medication and was extremely frightened to start it. i'm very happy so far.	1
25334	simponi felt like it was working the first 2 months. but my flare ups are still monthly and today after 6 months, my doctor said i am getting worse, and is taking me off simponi. i am 53, have rheumatoid arthritis since 2007.	0
229360	i was put on latuda recently after switching from zyprexa because zyprexa made me extremely fatigued. latuda doesn't make me as tired except for when i'm driving, when i feel like i'm about to fall asleep at the wheel and sometimes do close my eyes. in addition i'm hungrier than normal and even though i'm only eating 1,000 calories or less a day and am exercising at least 4 times a week i am not losing weight. i feel like i am suffering pointlessly for this. it hasn't helped my depression either. i am irritable a lot of the time and am still having mood swings. i think it may be time for me to quit meds for good. they haven't worked for anyone else in my family so why should they work for me? i need to get off of them.	0
223569	this knocked me out all day and didn't even help me sleep at night.	0
48984	after years of severely painful and agonizing 7 day heavy periods, my doctor recommended levora. i have been on this pill for over a year now and it has been amazing. only side effects i have had are positive- my boob size increased an entire cup and i have just about no acne! my periods have also shortened to less than 3 days and they are extremely light, no pain or headaches anymore either. my period comes the same time, same day, every single month. i was petrified to start birth control but i couldn't stand the horrible periods anymore. i am so happy my doctor suggested levora as i no longer lose sleep laying awake in pain! this pill has done wonders for me!	1
60737	while moviprep is okay at clearing the colon for a colonoscopy, there are two major problems with it. first is cost. this prescription medication costs between $80 and $90 with insurance, which is outrageous and confiscatory given the ingredients. second is drinking this vile liquid. it tastes so grotesquely bad, it is nearly impossible to choke down, and you have to drink two liters of it. i wish physicians would prescribe one of less-expensive, more-palatable alternatives.	0
23605	in july of 2014, i was given the diagnosis of ms. the medicine has worked well for me so far. i have headaches after infusions, they don't last long. i take cambia for the headaches. tysabri helps me to walk, drive, travel, and keep my job. my dizzy spells don't happen as much. tysabri is the only medicine i've taken for ms. i am still in shock from being diagnosed with this condition. i am very happy tysabri,even with the risks of jcv and pml.	1
73422	i usually have irregular periods. i missed 2 months so my doctor prescribed generess fe. it's cool that it's chewable but taking this drug was not a pleasant experience. for one, my mood swings were incredibly out of whack. i was so depressed and angry and irritable. i couldn't stand something like this having so much control over my emotions. i had serious bloating and my breasts were super swollen and i am already very busty so this was not very comfortable. i had painful migraines. the worst part about it was the crazy long periods! i've only completed 1 pack and i got my period last month but it's still going on, 15 days now!! it's not really heavy but it's more than just spotting. i stopped taking it	0
129606	i chose this option after being on pills for over five years and a trial of nuvaring for two months. i always forgot to take my pills and was getting too paranoid. tried out the ring which was a horrible two months of mood swings and discomfort. went in for the mirena and had it inserted when the dr discovered my uterus is too small for the mirena. so i went back a week later and had the smaller version skyla inserted. if pain is the only reason you haven't gotten an iud, stop worrying! my nose piercing hurt worse than both insertions of mirena and skyla. take 800mg ibuprofen before appt. and have a heating pad on hand. all i felt were cramps that were similar to usual menstrual cramps, nothing painful.	1
2592	i was diagnosed with sjogrens syndrome 3 months ago. i also have rheumatoid arthritis and hashimotos. my rheumatologist prescribed plaquenil in hopes to control all 3 conditions. i would say that plaquenil has basically given me my life back. i suffer from debilitating joint pain, fatigue, brain fog and extreme anxiety. i had to quit working because as a high school teacher, brain fog and anxiety, are probably 2 of the worst things you should be dealing with when dealing with teenagers. i would give plaquenil a 10, but i haven't been on it long enough to see the full effects. i continue to have more energy every day, i'm back to walking, as exercise, again and my joint pain is very well controlled.	1
57185	asthma for 40 years. ventolin/salbutamol works quickly and well to relieve an attack. severe attacks respond to much higher doses in a nebulizer. it does come with erratic heart rates however, so should not be over used and should be accompanied by a corticosteroid inhaler like becotide. (it is ridiculous that both ventolin and becotide had to be rejiggered to not use cfc gases for propulsion. neither has been as good since).	1
157053	i have fibromyalgia, ibs-c, &amp; worst of all, oic. i took as prescribed one day.i got horrible pain and withdrawal symptoms, gut gurgled for a couple hours in the morning. then zip, nada, nothing!! i was out after that. 2nd day too sick. i thought i should give it a 2nd try 2 wks later to make sure as i had high hopes i might get back some of my life. same again but worse. kept repeating symptoms at odd times for 4 days so far. i dread reliving withdrawals at bedtime. docs should know fibromyalgia is brain related disease so the med is crossing the blood barrier.	0
230707	got over the counter for severe respiratory congestion while traveling in bruges, belgium in 2012. extremely and quickly effective. will obtain additional supply in march 2015 when returning to belgium. no adverse effects.	1
5195	my pharmacist switched me to this pill. this is the second month on this brand and it's been giving me terrible moods swings, i feel like i'm pmsing everyday, and my period is irregular and barely anything comes out, thought i was pregnant. i'm switching back to aviane.	0
79539	had unprotected sex, took the pill within 1hour and i didn't feel anything for about a week. we both got scared, he told me to take a pregnancy test, it came out negative of course. then i got my period a week later from taking the pill and a week from i was supposed to get my period (it comes like clock work).	1
206769	i was a heroin addict for 4 years and i lost everything including my family. methadone helped me get my family back. if you are struggling with addiction, i highly recommend methadone... it saved my life.	1
80814	have no side effects to speak of. none of the usual predicted side effects. psa was in the high teens before provenge. that dropped to 1.03 psa. after treatment.	1
77844	i have never reacted to an antibiotic, ever, in my whole life. until now. within 30 mins of taking avelox, i was experiencing nausea, sweats, shortness of breath, heart flutters. i was so weak i had to be carried to bed. then the vomiting started, it was short-lived, but violent. it also has many nsaid contraindications, so be careful. especially if your sinus infection is very painful, watch what you take. glad to see it's worked for some - but for me.	0
154881	absolutely hate this medication. i've been in the hospital with the norovirus, just to find out i have c diff now and have been taking this medication 3x a day for 10 days. so sick of the nausea, can't tell anymore if the nausea is from c diff or the medicine. almost done with the medication and i couldn't be more happy. lost 15 pounds, haven't ate anything no matter how hard i try, dehydrated and sick to my stomach. absolutely hate this medication and the metallic taste.	0
217127	i've been on depakote, lithium and now trileptal. trileptal has given me absolutely no side effects, no weight gain and it controls my mood. i was bumping into walls, throwing up, feeling like i was high and eating everything in sight on depakote. i gained so much weight. on lithium, i did well, but couldn't deal with the gastrointestinal issues, as well as urinating every other hour, and being thirsty all the time. nothing quenched my thirst. this medicine is like taking a vitamin and it has stabilized my moods for almost 5 years now.	1
99715	my dr assurred me the best way to take the prep was mixed with either 7 up, sprite or ginger ale instead of water. no nausea. i drank it thru a straw. after finishing the two 16 oz, it was about 30 mins till my first movement and then just water. the next morning repeated prep, it was 10 mins later and i was on the toilet but only for about 2 hrs. then it was all over no residual effects. best prep ever. colon was clear and clean.	1
157532	i suffered from mild/persistent acne, which only got worse when i started college due to the anxiety and stress. the break outs become more frequent as the years went by, so i decided to see a dermatologist. i was first prescribed a treatment of facial cleansers, which worked for awhile, but my acne eventually came back. then my dermatologist decided to put me on on claravis (accutane). the first 2 months were hell, due to the extremely dry/sensitive skin. i suffered cuts daily and shaving became torture, i almost quit on the treatment. however, i turned a corner around the start of month 3 and haven't looked back. my treatment lasted 5 months, and since ending it in october 2016 my skin has been completely clear.	1
87652	ibuprofen bothers my stomach so i tried aleve/naproxen some years back and as to this day it works better then anything else, over the counter, that i have taken. it may not take away all the pain but it takes that evil edge off so the pain becomes less likely to make me vomit. i take aleve in the morning to prevent the pains and again when i do get the pains.	1
199271	this drug is a toxic poison and should be banned!!!! i took only one shot on june 17, 2015 due to complaining about painful periods due to a fibroid. worst mistake of my life... for the first month and a half i didn't have a period which was great! then on august 1st it started, badly. i woke up with blood clots the size of golf balls falling out of me, and my entire uterine lining, all at once, like my intestines were falling out. i haven't stopped bleeding and have even been put on a bc pill, acupuncture, nothing works. i was fainting, went to the er for blood transfusions. still hasn't stopped. i pray to god every day to help. help!!!!!! i've been hemorrhaging for 2 months now.	0
157234	my mother is on a dose of 21 mg namenda xr and i think it is making her symptoms worse. she is very medication sensitive and i see her chi as more depressed, forgetful, worrisome and confused. i will be discussing as always with her doctor but i feel she needs to be removed from this medicine. plus on a side note it is nearly impossible to get this medicine, although that has nothing to do with her taking the medication.	0
187463	i have been on antibiotic off and on for he last couple of months, definitely not my first yeast infection. i've never used monistat before so i figured i would ty it since it's saturday and i can't go to the doctor til monday. used the cream right before bed and didn't last two minutes, literally couldn't take it, the burning and itching and pain. miserable, it took me over a hour to remove the cream and i'm still uncomfortable! i will never buy this again, i'll just be uncomfortable til monday. i don't suggest anyone purchasing this product, especially if they have a history of sensitive skin or anything. i'm not sure why they would continue a product that everyone is having the same result	0
27548	ivermectin (soolantra) , in conjunction with daily minocycline, has completely cleared my rosacea. my skin is smooth for the first time in years. no bumps that hurt and look like acne, no redness looking like a diaper rash on my face. thank goodness for this medication. i apply it once daily after facial cleansing then apply my moisturizer and cosmetics and no problems!	1
40428	i have my doctorate in clinical counseling and am very aware of &quot;placebo&quot; effects of medication. i've had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia for years and have tried many pain medications and antidepressants. three months ago my physician prescribed savella and it has given me my life back. i had some side effects, not too uncomfortable, but continued savella and am so glad i did. if you are suffering from side effects, talk to your doctor and try to stick with savella until your body adjusts. brain fog is gone, even if i feel tired! physical pain not all gone but with fish oil tablets - all pain is gone and i can walk up and down steps, etc. fish oil: 1200 mg a day, 6 a day and more in the winter time. take care.	1
221291	never use this shot it makes your discharge thick and white after it wears off. you don't have a period for 2 years and it throws off the ph causing bv and frequent yeast infections also get a lot of head aches and low sex drive	0
124172	i had an absolutely terrible experience. i had it in for 6 months and had 2 periods a month, dibilitating cramps that made me cry from pain, mood issues, suicidal thoughts, terrible acne, and 20 pounds of weight gain to name a few. i now have self harm scars from how far this thing pushed me. i really wanted to like skyla but it did not work for me. don't make the same mistake i did, check if you have a progesterone intolerance before you get one of these things in!	0
53816	i have had severe migraines for 15 years and no medication has been able to give me much relief until i tried zipsor. my doctor gave me a few samples, to take up to 4 a day (which i assumed i'd be doing when a migraine came along). i took one pill and felt relief within 30 minutes and much better after an hour. i am so glad i have this medicine, it's a miracle!	1
197570	i have tried effexor, zoloft, prozac, celexa, cymbalta and paxil was the best. i only take 5 mg once daily in the morning and am good all the day ! really !	1
207724	i have a very sensitive gag reflex so it too me a while to finish the first dose. i couldn't even finish the second dose. besides the flavor, the nausea and stomach pain made my prep terrible. i would never take this again!	0
66077	taken for years battling anxiety, quite helpful if taken at onset of attack; bottom line-exercise for me is better!	1
91841	started taking 75mg twice a day for 1 month. maybe had a little reduced pain. notice a slight tremor in hands/coordination. trembling. i ignored this. had immediate huge increase in appetite. already overweight at 210 lbs. gained 12 lbs. in 3 weeks. my doctor increased my dose to 150mg twice a day.. sent me a second bottle 4 days after i had received the last bottle. i started taking two 75mg capsules twice a day as prescribed. wow. almost immediately i had much more trembling/uncoordinated in legs, arms, hands and difficulty controlling mouth during speech. while sitting these issues are very slight but still present. typing on a keyboard is difficult. but when i go to stand up and walk like i normally do without a problem...wow...	0
67282	i tried prilosec first for my heartburn symptoms but i noticed i had to take it a couple of times during the day which quickly added up. i found myself spending quite a bit of money.	0
227602	best birth control in my opinion. i have tried several. tiny pinch when they numbed it little sore for a couple days. 2 weeks in i started spotting for a month and now its been 9 months no cramps, weight loss, no mood swings and i have a light period for about 3 days a month.	1
68838	i've now had 2 depo shots. about 4 weeks into my second shot and i've been bleeding now for 14 days. it's weak but just isn't stopping. it's not painful but more annoying than anything. experiencing ongoing mood swings and gained 5kg in first 2months with no other change to diet/exercise. unsure if i need to keep taking the shot to let my body adjust or to stop now. have read stories of getting pregnant later can be much harder after depo too. lots of uncertainty, wish i had researched more before starting and perhaps tried the iud first.	0
103223	i'm so glad i decided to google this medication and found these reviews. i thought i was going nuts! my hormones are out of control on this medication. like others, my pharmacy switch me to estarylla from sprintec. i was fine on the sprintec but on this stuff - i've had horrible mood swings, my acne is out of control, spotting, nausea, weight gain, headaches. i thought i was pregnant! i'll be switching as soon as i can.	0
78453	i regret taking this. they will tell you that more progesterone isn't a bad thing, and then you'll get all the info on side effects from makena. it increases the risk of every pregnancy complication except preterm labor. i've dealt with no complications except preterm birth in my first two pregnancies. on makena, it's been a ride with painful injections, site reactions, fetal arrhythmia, gestational diabetes, low fluid, and i have felt like a crazy person. i was not informed, and i'd take my perfectly healthy 36 week pregnancy over this one any day.	0
177998	started taking cymbalta as a last resort for radicular sciatica pain. had surgery, tried many medicines. been on cymbalta for 1.5 mos. (5 days-20 mg, 5 days - 40 mg, 1 1/2 weeks - 60 mg, 2 days- 40 mg, 2 days- 30 mg). i experienced most of the side effects (nausea, lethargy, somnolence (sleeping 18-20 hrs a day for 3 wks from that to insomnia to today's date, flatulence, constipation, tingling all over, throat pain, blurry vision, nightmares, night terrors waking in drenching sweats, profuse sweating, hair loss). this is the weirdest medicine i've taken. taken fluoxetine for years with no unusual side effects or withdrawals. reducing because of side effects of night terrors, sweats, etc. it does work for pain but the cost is high.	1
139800	dont let these reviews scare you! every one is different 9 times out of 10 ppl who like this pill won't even share their experience its just the ones who don't like it! it's great i'm 24 and have had no period no symptoms what so ever. i'm already on anxiety meds but i don't take them and this doesn't change a thing in my mood i'm fine 100% i love this pill-no weight gain either. happy pill hunting!	1
55077	i'm a 43 yo f. started sat, 4/2/16. was at 233 &amp; am down to 213.8 6-weeks later. takes some adjustment getting used to the med &amp; new lifestyle. experienced nausea, constipation &amp; body shakes, but went away at full dose. full dose is when weight started dropping fast. i will experience nausea if i eat greasy/fatty foods so i avoid them. track my calories. reevaluated eating habits &amp; make better decisions. it stopped my cravings &amp; makes me eat small portions. practice moderation. not a miracle pill, takes commitment &amp; dedication to healthy lifestyle. lns doesnt cover but the scale down program makes it $70 to start. not sure how you can review a drug fairly the first week. there's going to be adjusting &amp; for me it's been worth it.	1
19050	when i fell off the wagon i was dreading another trip to the er when i sobered up. i saw my doctor and he prescribed this and it helped immensely. i have really bad panic attacks and my blood pressure skyrockets along with nausea, shakes, sweats, etc. this medicine helped get me off booze twice. recommended.	1
203611	i used zyban years ago to quit and it did help but i started again after i went off it. i have been trying to quit for the last year but haven't made it past a few days. i am 36 and have smoked since i was about 20, 16 years of damage to my lungs. i decided it's now or never i just want to be a non smoker so badly. i went and got a prescription for zyban 4 days ago and started immediately. so far i feel ok on it, i definitely feel different, time feels slower and i feel like i'm observing things differently in somewhat removed. today is my first day taking two pills and i'm a little worried i will feel messed up on the medication but gonna stick with it. i'm still smoking but plan on quiting within the next week.	1
30739	it is 1am and my lady parts are on fire. never again	0
127323	i have had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep for a long time, but with 3 mg of melatonin i fall asleep fast and stay asleep which is very nice.	1
92504	this is my miracle medicine. best medicine i have ever taken in my life. works for me in 1-2 minutes. have nausea from acid reflux and feel instantly better. a little sleepy but it doesn't put me in a deep slumber. love zofran.	1
42566	i was diagnosed with adhd in 2nd grade. i have been on medication ever since (i'm 31 now). i started concerta in high school and i must say it did very well to get me through class in college. i was even in my majors honor society. now i have to say i think the years of various medicines have caused some real adverse reactions. i'm very depressed and moody. i've gone from being the big go getter in my company to borderline at best. worst of all i have a new son and my anxiety is really getting in the way of me enjoying him.	0
72958	this is my first bc. for about the next 3-4 months, i had irregular periods with spotting here and there. this month, i totally skipped my period, as of right now i'm 17 days late. took a test and it came back negative, so i can attest to the missed period thing - don't be too stressed when/if it happens (if you take your pills correctly)! first couple months i cried a lot and had terribly sore boobs. they also grew from a 32b to a 32d though, so i'm not mad. no nausea at all. a few migraines. i'm not pregnant and we use withdrawal and never use condoms, so this pill is extremely effective and gives me that extra assurance for the lowest estrogen count. i'm a fan! 9/10 because of the scary missed period thing.	1
73913	well, this is the first birth control pill i've been put on in my life, and the first month was horrid. i had a crazy-long period and lost my sex drive and was an emotional wreck. it's been a second month now, and the spotting is gone and my sex drive is back and the period was very short, so i'm satisfied.	1
20847	my doctor prescribed rozerem last week. i have taken temazepam 30 mg for years but it had stopped being effective so we are testing alternatives. last night was the 7th night of taking rozerem- no help.	0
119013	been on 25 mg for 5 days now. was on lexapro 10 mg for 6 weeks before hand. after only 5 days i already feel better on the zoloft than i ever did in the whole 6 weeks of the lexapro. keeping my fingers crossed that i will keep feeling better. so far so good..no panic!	1
172582	best anti-epileptic around - no side effects unlike most of the other antiepileptic pills around which have really bad side effects --------- keeps the seizures right down and helps you feel ok and confident	1
202442	so far so awesome. been on it a week and am not as agitated. suicidal thoughts are going away.	1
35122	i woke up in the middle of the night after taking 3 doses (that's only 3 pills) in excruciating painit felt like someone had a huge sledgehammer and was slamming it against my left knee over and over again. the pain was so bad i even vomited. this pain lasted for weeks and i know have chronic tendonitis in that knee and am in constant pain. some days are better, but it's a constant pain and it's always swollen. it's been like this since 2009, it is now 2016. this class of drugs is toxic and should never be used as a 1st line of attack for infections; it shouldn't be used at all. don't ever take this drug or the others like it, they are called the &quot;fluroquinolones&quot; which also includes cipro, avelox to name a few.	0
64392	i have been on 50mg of zoloft for a little over 3 weeks now. for the first week i noticed no change then gradually i was feeling better. it has given me more energy and i feel i have a more positive attitude. i was overeating a lot due to stress and depression that has completely subsided. since i started taking it i have lost 19 pounds. that has also really helped with my depression. i am scared of my body getting used to it and go back to my regular habits. as for now i am happy.	1
218788	i was prescribed this medication to slow down the rate of growth for my large fibriods and to reduce cramping. here is how it has been thus far. weeks 1-3: very normal. no bleeding, no mood swings, no weight gain etc. weeks 4-5: very small old blood spotting. one panty liner a day is all i needed. weeks 6: mix of old blood and fresh blood. no cramps. weeks 7-8: heavy flow with very intense cramps. this is where i am currently at and i am not sure if i want to continue this medication. my cramps are more intense than when i was not on the medication. not to mention, i've been bleeding fresh blood for three weeks straight. i want to stick it out in order to give a full analysis of this medication, but i am not sure it is worth it.	0
27887	due to my increasing anxiety and panic attacks i was prescribed lexapro 10mg. during the first few weeks i became very sensitive and would nearly cry over simple things like a customer saying &quot;please don't put this item in the bag with that item...&quot;. i had very high blood pressure, bad headaches, rapid heart beat, i would feel weak and my body would start shaking (especially my hands). one time i even thought i was having a minor heart attack. i decided to ween off lexapro and change medication.	0
25138	i had my first 3 injections 5 years ago and helped me for 5 years of pain free knees. now 5 years later i have had my first injection yesterday and the next 2 in the next 2 weeks. hope this one will also do the job for the next 5 years. had no side effects whatsoever. i had a great doctor who did my hip replacement and also did the synvisc injections. the key is to get a good doctor to do the injections. i highly recommend this injection.	1
92617	absolutely stomps nausea. i took this pill during a bout of gastroenteritis when i felt nausea coming on. it took effect just as the nausea was about to cause vomiting, and turned it off like a switch. best anti-nausea medicine ever.	1
219694	started in 10mg per day of amitryptyline for daily jaw pain due to clenching teeth during the night. was waking up everyday in agony. 10mg seems to have stopped the jaw pain however was still waking up with terrible headaches every day. doc increased dose to 20mg. this had stopped the headaches too. also suffer from migraines. not had one of these either	1
120198	this medication worked great at stopping my cough immediately. i was diagnosed with bronchitis but i think it is now pneumonia. a strange thing happened though. i noticed every time i took it, a few hours later i would feel like i had the flu. my skin would hurt and i would actually get a fever which i didn't have before.	1
36488	i don't really know how to rate a medicine; i just share my experience. my doctor warned me that this antibiotic is very harsh and i might feel bad during the course. however, i am taking it for 8 days, and the only side effect i encountered is a bitter taste in my mouth, but it's not a problem. i just drink a lot and chew gum when it gets really bitter. i am of a slim and petite complexion (100 lb only), so i expected to have bad side effects, but i feel quite normal. also i am eating well before taking medicines (more veggies), drink lots of water, take strong probiotics (50 billion), and drink organic kefir with live culture before going to bed and taking bedtime portion of pylera.	1
179980	i've had the worst acne and blackheads since i was 12 or 13. i use cerave hydrating cleanser to cleanse my skin followed by epiduo in the morning. i moisturize with cerave a.m. moisturizing lotion. at night i cleanse and scrub off dead skin, and use retin-a micro gel followed by the cerave p.m. moisturizing lotion. let me start off by saying that i got discouraged the first week because my skin burned, started to peel, got flaky and just plain out looked like a red tomato. my first thought was i will not use this no more. i stopped for two days and just moisturized to heal my skin. i started back up again and told myself pain is just a physical feeling that the mind can overcome. i'm pulling through it and guess what? its working !	1
155828	i'm on my second to last day of treatment and so far i'm not seeing any results. i'm starting to think maybe i'm dealing with an yeast infection that i probably got from it. unpleasant pills that made these last few days a living hell for me. however, effective nonetheless.	1
50832	awful. took it about 2 hours ago and am currently sitting on the bathroom floor puking my guts up. hopefully i don't have to take these tablets again.	0
176632	this medicine is wonderful! i have severe anxiety problems that have been leaving me literally sleepless. i finally went back to my doctor after getting only 8 hours of sleep in 3 days. i was on lunesta sleep aid and he kept me on it, but added lorazepam and said to take it with my sleeping pills each night. now i'm out like a baby without a care in the world. i can still feel the effects the next day, as i'm much more relaxed about things. i would definitely recommend this to someone who has similar problems to mine.	1
219949	the nurse practioner told me to &quot;take this with one foot in the bed&quot;, implying that it was very powerful. nope!! the only thing it does for me is give me crazy dreams. it does nothing for my insomnia.	0
225446	according to my gp, bupropion (wellbutrin) takes 6 weeks to reach full effect. if you've been taking it for less time than that, wait! give it the full 6 weeks before you reach any conclusions. as for me, this medication is a godsend! i've had zero side effects. my thoughts are clearer, not bouncing all over the place. it's a lot easier to focus on things that aren't terribly exciting. i don't get distracted as easily. for me, this is awesome stuff. i take 300mg extended release once a day, in the morning.	1
206581	after taking it for 4 days it made me sick to my stomach and caused great muscle pain in my left leg.	0
201290	i have had good results with 200mg of zoloft, and .5 clonazapam 3 times a day, for ten years. i've tried many ssri meds, and zoloft has been the best so far. i suffer from depression, agoraphobia, panic and ocular migraine. this current combo ( sometimes i add gabapentin if i'm still anxious about leaving my house) has been the most effective for my mood. i gained weight on paxil and getting off was a nightmare. no additional weight gain with the zoloft.	1
157109	i've tried several over the counter acne medications and washes, home made applications and nothing seemed to work. i saw a commercial on differin gel and literally told myself, &quot; sure, another acne med that claims to be effective &quot; i figured, i might as well give it try considering i was beginning to accept my terrible acne. i saw results in a week or so and so did my family n friends. i am almost 2 months in and my face is practically clear, even the dark acne scars vanished. i highly recommend differin gel to everyone that is suffering from mild to severe acne, i promise!! i always apply the gel after washing my face in the evening, applying the gel all over my face and jaw bone. good luck!	1
139643	i had attempted suicide and was convinced my life was over prior to being on this, it saved my life plain and simple. i take risperdal to augment the effect of luvox. if you find the luvox isn't working entirely try adding on an antipsychotic, it did wonders for me. i have schizophrenia and ocd, so having an antipsychotic is absolutely essential. but yeah, luvox has done wonders for me. it may take a few months before you feel the full effects though. i just got raised to 200mg and so far so good. thank you luvox.	1
141983	i was prescribed lexapro about 3 years ago. i saw no change in my behavior except that i had no sex drive, no arousal, and it took me a long time to climax. even after 3 years i was still depressed and anxious. it was not the medicine for me.	0
189552	since taking this medicine i have been able to get out of my wheelchair. although in the beginning the side effects were a little hard to get used to it has greatly increased the quality of my life. i do however wish that it was more readily available to my pharmacy as there are times that i worry whether or not i will be able to get it and never knowing which brand i will get. each generic brand comes with its own set of side effects from headaches to itchy skin to nausea. they need to be more consistent with the inert ingredients to avoid this problem.	1
56384	i have been on all the medicines and have achieved remission of various lengths with gold injections (1.5 yrs), minocycline (8 yrs), enbrel (5 years before the efficacy started to diminish) and humira (1 year) over the past 30 years. as a result of all the medicine treatments i now have horrible lung complications similar to copd (have never smoked anything). when the pain is excruciating you are willing to take anything to make it better. enbrel and humira have left me with a continuous sinus infection that i keep under control with regular salt water rinses. i have no ability to fight off infection and keep getting lung infections which require me to stop the injections for the arthritis and every time you stop, your body builds immunity.	1
81490	i started on 08/31/2017, so only my second dose of 0.6 mg. no side effects at this point. dr. administered the first injection at the office around noon yesterday. by that evening, i wasn't hungry and seemed to have more energy than normal. took the second dose at 7 am this morning. haven't felt like eating, and my normal coca cola (my drug of choice) just didn't taste right. which i feel is a good thing. easier to stop something when it doesn't taste good. i am 49 years old, pcos, and yesterday at the dr. office weighed in at 330.4 lbs. i got my insulin tested this morning fasting. i will meet with the nutritionist next week. since this is a great long weekend, i am planning on starting the keto diet that my dr. is recommending.	1
65667	game changer if you fear public speaking. it solves the problem. 20mg - 1h before the speech and you will be calm and relaxed like if you are in a bar with friend speaking about football. i just mind why i did not start before... i have lost so many years	1
170855	i was hospitalized and couldn't sleep due to intense anxiety in the hospital. i was given 50mg seroquel. i felt the effects within 20 minutes, but then they kept getting stronger for well over an hour until my perceptions of time and space were very distorted. i couldn't even sit in a chair without feeling i was going to fall out of it. next i started getting paranoid until 16 hours later i took klonopin and everything went back to normal. if i was at home or work and took seroquel for the first time, it would have been a disaster. i did sleep for a few hours while i was on it, though.	0
185249	on my 5th week of 12. because of the slight nausea, i found it eased up if i eat supper a few hours before i take the medication. taking it at night before i go to bed has been working very well for me as it makes me tired [sure gonna miss the sleep aid when treatment is over!]. occasionally i've felt a slight headache; drinking water usually takes it away with no additional medication. i 'play' with my diet to eliminate bowel problems and a daily walk also seems to help. my current lab shows it's working!!	1
66026	didn't do much for my anxiety. i still had shortness of breath and that &quot;pit&quot; in my stomach. there was maybe a little less shakiness, but other than that, i still felt anxious. now i'm on lorazepam, which works much better for me. however, i could understand why many people do not want to take benzos might want to at least give this a try. it just wasn't for me.	0
200445	i am on day 8. the only side effect i have had as of now is a headache, i have had it for about 5 days now. i smoked about a pack a day before and i have not had a cigarette today as of yet, i did smoke twice yesterday though. i'm keeping my fingers crossed!	1
178716	rapid heart rate, persistent nausea, respitory issues, loss of voice. dry skin/throat, abominal pain, back pain, constipation &amp; bloating or frequent gas... it has really messed me up!	0
45317	cured my panic disorder, which was huge. also levelled me off emotionally. but...sexual disfunction is definitely an issue. i also seem to have a lack of empathy for others that i don't like. overall, though, i've been helped by this med.	1
22439	i'm on a daily medication for migraines but still sometimes get one that will last for 3-4 days. nothing was working until i tried treximet. migraine is gone within 30 minutes.	1
211761	for me the side effects greatly outweighed the benefits since i didn't feel any benefits. this medicine might be effective for the treatment of something. however bi-polar/depression not so much. not a whole lot of fun when you stop taking it either.	0
31564	do not ever ever ever use this. worst itching burning stinging of my life. go to a doctor, get a pill prescription because this is the worst pain.	0
55578	i have ongoing difficulties with reactions to many foods..constant stomach aches, bloating, constipation, cramps, diarrhea, frequent bowel movements...this med has created more of the above and gives me a headache. i really have no idea if i should stick with it for the 4 - 6 weeks to see if the lining of my gut will heal? i'm desperate and disgusted with my condition, and the lack of response to this &quot;medicinal food&quot;.	0
120822	i have tried this medication without success. when my cravings became too difficult i would stop taking the medication and plan my drinking for 4 to 5 days later which sometimes wasn't enough time to get the medicines out of my system and became very ill. my recommendation is if you are going to use this medication and you don't trust yourself have someone else administer the pills to you and keep you accountable. congratulations to those who have found success on this. i'm trying campral next.	0
87245	i have bipolar1 disorder with history of psychotic features. i have just started taking 40 mg of latuda per day, as i am being weened from 900 mg of lithium. i was having so many adverse side effects, such as tremors, extreme dry mouth, weight gain and thyroid issues. additionally, it didn't seem to be working very well. after a few days, i notice an amazing positive change in my mood, my appetite, and stability. i am still on 800 mg. of seroquel/day and 150 mg of pristiq, but it all continues to go well, seroquel will be the next to be reduced. i am very optimistic, and have not felt this way in a long time.	1
184002	doesn't do much for my anxiety or promote sleep (i take a dose at bedtime). vistaril is basically prescription benadryl.	0
33669	i had a bad experience with this. i was pretty healthy prior to using this birth control. i even stopped smoking cigarettes because i knew it would make everything worse. i started taking microgestin two weeks ago and have become very ill. my side effects were high blood pressure, chest pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision, water retention, swelling fingers, dizziness, racing heart, feeling very tired and depressed. it had a few benefits: clearing up my face and regulating my period but the side effects were too many to handle. i know it works different for everyone but i wanted you guys to know that these risks are possible especially if you smoke or used to smoke. i am going to get switched to a different birth control. best of luck!	0
22215	i have a lot of different pains due to fibromyalgia and nerve damage and sciatica and a stroke and spinal cord disease i take 1 20 milligram at night only because it does make you very tired and only time i really noticed it working is when i don't take it then my pain is much worse.	1
337	i'm 18 years old. i never been on any other birth control but the 3 months on depo-provera...i bled for 2 months as well as depression. i was pmsing the full 2 months. caused problems in my relationship because of it.	0
164421	taste terriable. made my stomach hurt and did nothing for headache	0
19555	i would give it a 10, then a 1. at first the medicine worked great but then 30 days later it just quit. after a few months i gave up on it, i occasionally retry the medicine but no luck.	0
119796	i've tried several different sleep medications for insomnia and while attempting to get used to the cpap machine for sleep apnea. ambien cr works great, i can get a full nights sleep, however go to bed within 1 hour of taking the medication or you will feel a bit drugged. i don't recommend taking every night, it is addictive (try not to take more than 3 nights in a row). it is more difficult to wean off from than regular ambien. overall, if needed this is a good medication if taken responsibly.	1
171651	i was recently put on wellbutrin by the college's psychiatrist. i just started it yesterday and i feel great. the things that i used to dwell are not on my mind. i woke up early this morning for work, and i never do that. i smiled today and i feel like having new adventures and not concentrating on things that make me upset. i am sure there will be better days to come and i am so excited.	1
192195	i'm currently still on yaz because my mother won't let me off of it. i'm 18 and not using yaz for contraception but for depression and anxiety which i find horrendous that my doctor has kinda just gone &quot;you're a female it must be your period!&quot; idiot. however yaz was kind of working at the start everything has gone downhill and now in my 4th month of using it i'm thinking of stopping taking them against my doctor and mother because my periods irregular, i drink a lot of water but i'm constipated daily, i have funny discharge, i've put on weight, i have headaches and feel dizzy, closer to my period i get sick and feel like vomiting and i'm not happy these pills don't help me how they're supposed to they just hurt me.	0
78517	do not use this if you suffer from anxiety. this made mine way worse, i've been suffering anxiety, depression, and bad mood swings since taking this. i have had two periods each month with bad cramping.	0
780	prescribed by urologist with samples for trial. found negligible benefit for the intended purpose (very weak urine flow) but severe interference with sexual fulfillment and inordinately high price. i quit after six weeks.	0
23871	i had very sudden onset post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and psychotic depression. what absolute hell i was going through for a good 18 months of doctors experimenting with different medicines on me. all the other antipsychotics had bad effects on me and made my depression worse. my last admission to hospital was for my own safety and as a last ditch effort when i was suicidal my psychiatrist thought we'd try saphris. within 4 days i noticed a complete change for the better. it helps me sleep but i suspect it also takes away a bit of my drive to exercise which i hate because i used to work in the fitness industry. i do take 2 other medicines so it could be the combination. generally a positive experience with this medication.	1
196907	i was suffering from ppd/a. zoloft and lexapro made me feel worse. i wanted to try paxil but the bad reviews scared me. good thing i listened to my doctor because it's the only thing that has helped me. side effects weren't bad. i haven't gained weight. i feel a little hyper sometimes but that just makes me actually want to get up and do things again.	1
225839	i'm on my 5th day of starting welbutrin sr (generic) 100mg and feel more energetic and less depressed and lethargic. that could be a placebo effect so early in treatment, but i know for sure that its almost completey taken away my appetite. i actually forget to eat. i had been on prozac, which worked great at first and then the therapeutic effects seemed to fade over the months until i was severely depressed again. this has happened to me with several other antidepressants as well. i hope that welbutrin will work consistently for me. so far i'm very happy with the results.	1
164083	i was in the hospital and the nurse gave me this medication and it woked really good i have used day quill ibuprofen and many more medication and motrin worked the best	1
95773	i'm 19 and zoloft has been a lifesaver for me! i've had very bad generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, and mild depression. i recently had been on xanax then klonopin as needed, but i felt as if those types of medications wouldn't help me in the long run. i've been on 25 mg of zoloft for a month and a half, and i feel wonderful! the horrible, disabling anxiety i once had is almost nonexistent, and my depression melted away! my mood is stabilized, i have a lot of energy, focusing on school work is a synch, and i interact with others with confidence. yes, i feel like a totally renewed, cleansed person with a constant sense of motivation! zoloft saved my life! little to no side effects either. very mild antidepressant.	1
122405	i used linzess a couple of months, i didn't like taking it first thing in the morning and then wait 30 minutes before i can take my breakfast. some days i felt awful after taking it, my stomach felt like it about to explode! my doctor prescribe me with some other drug called trulance and i think it's much more tolerated, and it works better for me.	0
95610	used twice daily for six months, nothing!	0
58495	after starting this birth control, i experienced mood swings of irritability and anger within taking the first pill, i also experienced severe bloating and bad acne. my milk supply dried up, which i was prescribed this pill to avoid decrease in milk supply. this is a horrible pill with horrible side effects.	0
194524	started on 10mg daily in may. began having headaches daily and my joints in my hands increased in pain, especially in the am. i am in my 4th month now headaches are much better. hands still hurt but seem a little better. now my back aches a lot and i feel tired every morning. it's like i stayed up half the night making it a chore to get up and get ready for work. i worry about all the things this drug may be doing to my kidneys, liver and muscles. however, after 3 months my cholesterol and ldl dropped significantly. i would like to maybe decrease to every other day or maybe try diet and exercise again.	1
163878	diabetes, type 1 with insulin resistance. i use lantus and rapid acting novolog together along with diet and exercise to adjust my blood sugars and get my a1c's where i want them. i know where i feel my best, for me its 100 -120 and my doctor says they work for him too. when i was 1st diagnosed 3 years ago they said i was type 2 but later found i really was an misdiagnosed type 1. not that it really makes a difference as long as its controlled, which mine is with lantus and novolog. neither of which are covered by my insurance. luckily i found a clinic that only charges $5 per box. i need 1 box plus 1 pen of lantus and 2 boxes of novolog per month sometimes more so i keep 4 boxes in the fridge.	1
159769	i hope my information can help someone! here's my story i was put on bactrim for 7 days for a uti. it helped my symptoms but my urine looked off, i finished the course there was blood in my urine but no infection. uti symptoms back. i went to doc and begged for another course of bactrim. i had bladder spasms and that urine color came back. i thought i was doomed for ic. weird until i researched and found out that bactrim can cause bladder spams and blood in urine! i stopped the antibiotic (ask doc first) and decided to detox my liver with tumeric tea(recipe online) currently symptom free!! not sure why docs prescribe this if side effect is drug in urine could be dangerous if you think blood is from infection! (for me it was dark tea color	0
159678	i was prescribed bactrim for a uti i and after one dose i immediately developed a splitting headache followed later by weakness, body aches, chills, fever, slight nausea, cough and sore throat. i feel as if i have the flu. i suppose the medication did do what it was supposed to do because the uti feels as if it's almost completely gone (i'm sure it isn't but at least it doesn't hurt). i will say i don't think the side effects are worth it. i'm in a lot of pain and discomfort and i think i'll be going to the emergency room just to be on the safe side.	0
72547	my doctor perscriped it and i am alcoholic. that is not a good combination; espesically since he knew i was alcoholic.	0
192719	had severe mood swings, dry eyes to the point of not being able to wear contacts, weight gain, breast tenderness.	0
23661	the disease modifying medications had no effect on my multiple sclerosis. tysabri stabalized the progression but saw no improvement.	1
101669	felt like a fart but it was a shart. saw double, can't sleep, loss appetite , dizzy, chest pains my chest felt heavy, it did make my head forget about the pain but it was still there. bilateral spinal muscles where in spasm. t12 l1 and 2. problem. never took this drug ever and wont ever again. nauseated diarrhea bile colored. i took half the pill . it is nothing like motrin. flexaril is a safer medication less likely to shart your pants. but took what was prescribed never heard of this drug before.	0
156470	i'm halfway through week nine on this medication and have no complaints at all. i've had absolutely no spotting or cramping. i had bad hormonal acne before starting this pill (i was not on any birth control prior to taking amethia) but now i rarely break out except for a few stress related pimples in the past couple of weeks. i haven't had a period on this yet, but so far my body has taken to this medication very well. no weight gain or mood changes either that i have noticed!	1
80675	it is by far the best cough suppressant for which i've been given a prescription.	1
225900	i have been on this for over a month and there is good news and bad news. good news is the pill works very well. bad news is lots of side effects. i am dizzy, unstable on my feet, light headaches, low energy and others. i have lost about 8 pounds which is good. today my doctor cut my dose in half. i hope this keeps working because it works on depression.	1
161137	after taking risperidone for 6 months to relieve my panic, fear and irrational thoughts associated with my ptsd, i encountered very little relief. what i did gain was the weight. i gained 50 lbs in 6 months with no change in eating habits. after voicing this concern to my doctor, i was taken off the medication with no withdrawal effects and in 10 months time i lost 49lbs with no exercise and eating a healthier low glycemic index diet.	0
111592	i get chronic uti's and kidney infections. i recently found out that my chronic infections have led to scarring of my left kidney and both ureters so i go in for a cystoscopy and videourodynamics in december. cipro is the only thing that works for me. it works fast too. i usually get bad headaches with this medicine, but i am prone to headaches as well...lucky me. i always make sure i take good probiotics when i am on this medicine to replenish the gut flora. bactrim is weak and never works...cipro is the only thing that works for me and my body. everyone's body is different so do your research and talk to your doctor about your concerns.	1
116592	i have bph and overactive bladder. i take avodart, vesicare and uroxotral. i have been taking these three for years and have noticed little or no difference in my urinary habits. i still go on average once an hour and recently have started to wake up in the middle of the night three times versus 1 or 2 times prior to the last few months. i am going to speak to my doctor because these meds seem to be not helping me.	0
152433	i have taken cipro before for my urinary tract infection. it worked then but not this time around. i now have hives and am very itchy with headaches.	0
149668	i have had my mirena in now for about a year and i couldn't be happier. i am a mother of two young children and wanted a fool proof method of birth control as the idea of possibly having a third scared me! i decided to try out mirena since i was terrible at remembering to take the pill. i am not going to lie. i think the worst part about the iud was the pain following insertion. i had really intense cramping after insertion that lasted for a full day. after that i bled for weeks. the bleeding eventually stopped and now i don't have periods. i haven't gained any weight or had problems with acne, mood or libido. most of the time i forget i even have it. i would recommend the mirena.	1
33554	i have just been on microgenstin fe 1/20 for a month now. no period yet, which made me nervous until reading some these reviews. i was on microgestin fe 1.5/30 and wanted something with less estrogen. i have lost five pounds, no mood swings and i'm loving it. only thing is night sweats and more emotional at times.	1
140186	i had been taking saphris 10mg at bedtime for well over a year and then suddenly stopped taking it for a month to see how i would feel. in this month i was a wreck and had racing thoughts and couldn't fall asleep until 2am and would be up 6 hours later. i also found myself fantasizing about stuff and being unrealistic about things. i started taking it again close to a month ago and i really see how much it helps me. the only downside is that i sleep over 11 hours now and i get into such a deep sleep without waking up once.	1
224479	my disabled brother was previously prescribed generic levothyroxine and brand name, synthroid. on both, he was basically in a continual state of lethargy to the point where he would fall asleep on the commode or at the dining table. never heard of tirosint until requesting help. this medicine has been incredible. no more lethargy and continuous sleeping during the day. family members have commented that he is more alert, engaged and seems to be happy. they would be correct!	1
49191	*last update*...i gave these pills six months and that's all i could take. the last straw was when i started my period randomly while in key west on vacation. i switched back to my ortho lo, but not before i went from 132 to now 153 in a matter of months. i'm frustrated, bloated and desperate. i hired a personal trainer, have been running, drinking a ton of water, eating only around 1200-1400 calories a day, and i'm not even exaggerating, i gain a pound and a half a week. stay away. remember when caty gave regina the swedish weight gain bars and said they were for losing weight, and then regina ended up wearing sweatsuits everyday, but caty said to &quot;give them a chance?&quot; it's the same thing. these are mean pills.	0
76630	i have been taking this for 5 days but my side effects are horrible. the drug is working so well i'm trying to push through. first two days i had a really bad headache and was so nauseous it was really bad. the nausea left but then on the 3rd day a severe rash developed. it has been miserable. i'm going to give it another day or two because my appetite is so much less than it's ever been. it's almost shocking. i have to make myself eat. really hoping the itching goes away.	1
151495	chantix was the easiest way i could have imagined to quit my 30 year, 2 pack a day habit. it took two rounds since i fell off the non-smoking wagon after the first attempt but i'm now smoke free for over three years. i had some vivid dreams but to be honest, i enjoyed them! :)	1
71973	dangerous addicting drug with strong side effects on and coming off. just because it's synthetic does not mean it's like an opiate! it affects serotonin and will cause problems getting off it in terms of mood and nervous system reactions as wells as muscle pain increased who coming off.	0
224250	i was on levothyroxine for 10 years and it never did anything for me. my levels were never optimal and i continued to gain weight, be depressed, and waste money on a useless drug. so far with the tirosint my only side effect is a slight headache. for the first time in my life my hormone levels are excellent, but my wallet is empty. tirosint is ridiculously expensive. i use a compounding house which sells a month supply to me for $68 (willow), as opposed to the $125 per month that cvs wanted. i feel the price is a disgrace and something needs to be done about this. i have insurance that does not cover this drug (bcbs). my doctor gave me a discount coupon for $35 a month but blue cross blue shield would not honor it. ask your doc for this.	1
179175	i love zyprexa (olanzapine) it has calmed and removed my insanity. i now longer have panic attacks and irritability. i work in retail and i have been in trouble several times with my managers because i snap at costumers. but with zyprexa it all went away it was amazing........but!!! i have to stop taking it because it caused so much weight gain. i use to weigh 170lbs and within a year i weigh now 226lbs. i don't even eat that much and i still don't lose weight. there's no point going to the gym and doing cardio because the pill prevents me from losing it. so now i have to ask my doctor to give me a medication that doesn't cause weight gain for i can lose the weight. i am so depressed that i have to stop taking it. it has worked wonders 4 me	1
191825	i am 19 and was diagnosed with adhd when i was in elementary school. i have had my fair share of add/adhd drugs that i have liked or disliked. for years i had been taking concerta but i felt like it didn't do much for me. my grades started slipping during my sophmore year in high school and i decided that enough was enough. so i did some research and started reading about vyvanse. my doctor didn't know much about it because it is a fairly new drug. i started taking 50mg of vyvanse when i was 18 and have seen nothing but positive effects. i went from a 3.0 to a 4.1 gpa. it only lasts for about 5-6 hours so my doctor perscribed 5mg of adderall to take. i have loads of studying to do. this drug is simply wonderful. the reviews are helpful.	1
27054	no relief at all. no upset stomach or any other side effects.	0
11763	my pcp put me on this and i took my first injection this past saturday night. woke up to horrible nausea and sulphur burps on sunday. still dealing with those today (wednesday). vomited three times at work monday around 2, and the nausea deceased for a couple hours afterwards. however the nausea returned with a vengeance, and i took phenergan and went to bed early when i got home. back to work on tuesday but had to leave after only 3 hours after the vomiting started again. began having abdominal pain and diarrhea as well and spent most of the day yesterday in bed, eating phenergans as often as i could. still sick as a dog this morning and called in for the day. i will but be taking another injection, and i pray this poison wears off soon!!	0
204167	has anyone taking dilantin ever experienced nipple tenderness? i have only been taking it for a month at 200mg qhs. all of the sudden a few days ago both nipples started to increase in tenderness and i have not ever experienced this. i am a 31 year old female with multiple diagnosis and was just hoping for someone to talk to. thanks.	0
155644	on my 5th day of 7 of the pill. it has taken full effect on clearing up any situation i had before. however has have left me to be constipated, bloated, fatigued and made me gain weight.	1
86857	i initially went on it for depression. it worked great. but years had passed and everyday was the same i was never moving forward. i was forgetting a lot of things. i'm in my 30s i felt as if i was in my 70s when it came to memory. the ability to converse normally decreased over time. i would forget at-least 2 words every few sentences and i would forget obligations and functions. when i went off of it my room was clean for the 1st time my car was clean for the 1st time and for the 1st time i wasn't craving stimulants. i feel alive again.... 3 months off latuda	0
449	i've only had my first shot. the first month was okay. i was always hungry, severe backaches &amp; headaches, and few hot flashes. i got my cycle a week or so late. i'm in my 2nd month and i've been having really bad cramps, constant bleeding, and diarrhea. no weight gain, at least not yet.	0
121486	i use to have panic attacks everyday for three years. i was scared to go to sleep. i've tried so many antidepressant and effexor was the only thing that worked with little to no side effects. my dr. started me on 75mg, then increased it two wks later to 100mg. i've been on 100mg for almost a yr and i still haven't had a panic attack or anxiety.	1
102415	i had taken abilify (aripiprazole) for around 6 months when i decided to stop taking it. not only is it super expensive, but i found it didn't work for me at all. when i first started taking it i was very sedated and tired. eventually it had no side effects on me, but no positive ones either! my mood swings were constant and my outbursts weren't any less. nobody in my immediate family who were aware of my bpd noticed a difference. it didn't work for me, but it is definitely worth a try because it doesn't have any major side effects like weight gain. just very pricey.	0
20027	i started macrobid yesterday and i felt okay but today i've had the most horrible painful stomach cramps and the weirdest constipated diarrhea i have ever had. i am constantly feeling like i need to throw up and the bowel movements and pain are what prompted me to do some internet digging. i have taken four of 100mg pills in two days and i refuse to take another. at work today i nearly tripped several times and i was disoriented, felt sick, and had difficulty walking straight. there are other meds out there and while i know that everyone reacts differently to medication, i seriously would not wish this stomach/abdominal pain on anyone; it is incessant and keeping me from sleeping. i pray for alleviation tomorrow but fear it may take a few days.	0
192779	i'm 17 and have been on ocella for about 9 months, if not more. in terms of effectiveness, i can't say i know, because i use a condom every time i have sex. however, it has done wonders for my acne, and i haven't had an increase in weight. but i've noticed recently, that whenever i have my period, i end up being in a terrible mood. i don't want anyone to talk to me, or anything. i want to cry. i'm either pissed, or i cry. another bad thing i noticed is my sex drive has gone way down. i'm considering changing it, but i need the pills for periods as well, my periods are very irregular, but i want to be on birth control since i am having sex.	1
183976	this drug has worked great for my anxiety. i'm prescribed 25mg twice a day as needed and then two before bedtime for sleep issues. it definitely works. just be warned that it will make you extremely loopy until you get used to it. be careful with the alcohol with it because it triples the effect of it. keep it to one drink maximum.	1
126093	i was given this medicine for depression/anxiety, i had many of the bad side effects listed on the insert. my world became even darker than before and i started having suicidal thoughts. i thought i was losing my mind. i was not myself on this medication. i started having panic attacks and just feeling so out of control. my family was worried because of the severe reaction that i had. after changing to a different medication i was back to myself within a few days.	0
141363	i am a 18 yo girl and diagnosed for depression. my 1st week with 10 mg lexapro is beyond horrible: depression got worse, heart racing, sharpened negative thoughts, and no motivation at all when wake up in the morning. i cant concentrate and feel as if i wanna cry most of the time. it lingers till evening and tapers off toward night. at night, i feel euphoric. no problem with sleeping and weight gain. but since my depression got worse, doctor decided to double my dose to 20 mg. 2nd week was even worse: nightmare every night, fatigue, lethargic, gases in stomach. in 3rd week, it finally helps!! negative thoughts went away and i feel lightheaded. side effect: emotion numbness, sleepy, lazy. but overall this medicine is a true miracle.	1
108759	nexplanon ruined my life. i had it implanted in october of 2015. i started bleeding two days later and i kept bleeding for five months until the gynecologist gave up trying to fix it and took it out. i was anemic and sick by the end. it was only effective birth control because it made it impossible to do the deed. ever since then, i have had horrible periods. they stretch on and on. they start two weeks early even on the pill. i never had these problems before nexplanon. i've been on multiple different birth controls since, several different bc pills and now nuvaring. sometimes it stops the irregular bleeding. but never for long. on july 5th i started my period. it's now august 14th. it's not stopping again. nexplanon ruined my life.	0
161715	remeron helps me to go to sleep when i get ready. i still wake up at night but fall right back to sleep. i haven't noticed any abnormal weight gain or urges to eat more at night.	1
68971	i started depo last month of this year the first month was cool but this month got my period not to heavy but been bleeding for almost 2 weeks now don't think i'll get the second shot from what i'm seeing with the reviews thinking of the pill even though it's to late for me now	0
302	i was pretty terrified to try it out hearing &amp; seeing all these bad reviews. i got my first shot in november, around the time my period was ending. so far, that was my last period. the first month, i did get a little bit of cramping which i usually don't get. i haven't had any cramping since then. &amp; also by the time i was due for my second period, i spotted instead for maybe 10 days (my periods usually last 5-7 days) &amp; it seemed like it was more like discharge than it did spotting. again, that's been it, no more periods so far nor spotting. as for gain weight, i may have gained a few pounds, honestly not sure. i never step on a scale. but nothing drastic. i just recently got my second depo on february 12th, we'll see if all goes well.	1
176643	i couldn't think straight, get a full breath, became very disorientated and nothing made sense. for a long time i thought i was going crazy! i started the drug and only had to use 1mg once a month due to an attack. after a bad break up and change in life i experienced anxiety everyday and the only thing that will stop that is this pill. it works great but don't like how i have to take once a day now. i believe once i get to a better place in my life i will need less doses. i will not go anywhere without my bottle. i am trying to get off this pill now and trying it with the lexapro.	1
121406	my doctor prescribed venlafaxine for my hot flashes. when i talked to her about going on hormone therapy she suggested that venlafaxine may be a good option and not understanding much about anti-depressants it sounded like a good idea.. wow was i wrong! i took this medication for a total of approx. 2 months. at first 37 mg worked great but then my body adjusted within a few days and the hot flashes returned i ended up increasing to a total of 3 37mg per day tablets but continued to have hot flashes and my sex drive became non-existent. i finally realized what i was doing to my body when i ran out for almost 5 days and the withdrawal symptoms made me feel like a zombie (seriously). this stuff is a very strong drug and very addictive.	0
52209	after having my first child, i realized i had gained 80lbs! my original weight pre-baby was 130, but when stepping on the scale before delivery i weighed 207. i am a short woman, and so this weight is very showing on me. i have taken this medicine about a year previous and lost 10lbs on my own after the medicine, so now this year my doctor said i could try them again since i was taking 3 different anti-depressants that counter acted with the medicine. so now i'm on it again, but it is no miracle pill. i have been on it a week and lost 10lbs yes, but i work out every single day. it is there to help you control portions and teach your body to not overeat. most women when getting off this medication go back to their original weight.	1
78888	i experienced what is described as &quot;blue/purple finger(s)&quot; in my left hand. after an intensive vascular examination, this was determined to be caused by vascular spasms. after being prescribed trental by my doctor. the blue/purple condition of my hand fingers returned to normal skin color in about two or three days. there were no noticeable side effects and when i stopped taking the medication, the condition did not return to &quot;blue/purple&quot; and to date remains a normal skin color.	1
13515	i've been on adderall for six months for narcolepsy. it has given me a life back. it has helped my severe daytime sleepiness by about 80 %. there are times if i'm really really tired that i can tell the med doesnt help. but mostly it is excellent. the only thing i don't like about it is the crash after the med wears off. i can tell a huge difference. and it is also disappointing that i have to take meds to stay awake each day. but overall, i would say i'm very thankful for it.	1
97064	i have been on this medicine for two weeks now. i have read a bunch of those comments and they all helped me. thanks. i put them all together and here is mine. honestly, it's not working! i take with food, i have nausea, i get tired, (the first day, i was so sleepy), dizzy, afternoon hunger, still crave for carbs in the middle of the day, headaches, stomach pain, and now that i take one at night too, i understand, after reading some comments, why i have being having weird dreams. i have an appointment with my doctor coming march because she told me contrave can increase my blood pressure and she wants to monitor very close. i also feel bad about the price, not worth!	0
24893	just turned 50 and i've fought with bipolar disorder and depression my entire life. i've been taking 300mg of lamictal to control mood swings and 1.5mg of klonopin to treat chronic anxiety. depression was still so overwhelming that i asked for an anti-depressant. the md prescribed 200mg of wellbutrin sr which had a positive effect, yet did not get rid of the underlying thoughts of death and dying; many of you will understand that i'm talking about a coping mechanism not actually wanting harm myself. a pharmacist told me to ask my md about deplin and that was the best medical advice i've ever received! i've been taking 15mg daily for over two months and have not felt this &quot;normal&quot; for many years! thanks for reading my opinion.	1
13770	i can finally really concentrate and feel in control.	1
192259	i've been using gianvi for the last 4 years. other pills used to make me spot inbetween periods. this pill changed everything! my period is so regular now comes every month on the expected day always within 3 hours of each other. way less cramping, no side effects, and it only lasts around 4 days. make sure you get gianvi and not a generic version as they effected me differently. awesome bc!	1
26296	was having abnormal bleeding for month went to emergency room was prescribed pro era for 10 days the day after period and blood clots came back. went to gyno took ultrasound no polyps no fibroids nothing but was told the lining of uterus is thin. was given this medicine to take 3 a day first 3 days then 2 a day next 2 then 1 a day. the bleeding has stopped for now and i'm ok day 4. everyone body reacts differently i haven't had any mood swings or no other side affect so i'm thankful for this birth control..	1
215672	after having my 3rd child i had the paragard inserted march 2017. i thought it was a great option because it was hormone free. i got my first period and it was normal but in april i did not get a period at all and was worried i was pregnant. the past month i have been severely bloated to the point that i look 5 months pregnant. it's not the baby weight because i had been working out 5 days a week and my stomach was relatively flat again until the last month. the bloating is very uncomfortable as well. it is now may 2017 and for the past two weeks i have been nauseous, had cramps and been spotting. i finally got my period yesterday and it is very heavy to the point i bled through two outfits. i used to have a light period that lasted 2 days.	0
211573	previously on bydueron, which worked really well! unfortunately, my insurance stopped covering it. tried trulicity..made me sick. started tanzeum in april 2016, and my numbers have gotten worse, i've gained 15 lbs and it's making feel down. i will be asking my doctor to put me back on bydureon and hopefully the insurance will cover.	0
195403	i have used copaxone off and on for about 5 years. i don't like the injection sight reactions but they are small compared to some of the other treatments i have used. i was on tysabri and it was great. i felt normal as before ms for about 2 weeks every month and 2 weeks waiting for the next infusion. due to liver problems my doctor recommended i go back on copaxone but with injections every other day. i have done this for 2 years and no relapse.	0
31557	so i bought it today , took a shower had my bed ready so i can lay down right away , inserted the cream &amp; omg i never felt itch so crazy , i had to wash it off and now i feel lil okay but still itch and burns i'm glad i'm not the only one hopefully i feel better tommorrow but i rather go with the pill never again	0
55378	i am just finishing my second week taking contrave and have lost 10 lbs. it has been an interesting experience because the drug is definitely not an appetite suppressant, yet it does help you control the urge to eat. i have had mild side effects - some stomach discomfort and slight headaches along with constipation, but it has all been easily manageable. if you are considering taking this medication please keep in mind that you still need to do the work by exercising and eating right, but the medication really does help. it has helped me get my motivation back to exercise, and it definitely helps with cravings to eat making it easy to just eat what i need to be healthy. use the coupon they give you, it drops cost to $70	1
194642	have been on gilenya just shy of 2 years with no relapses. my last mri showed no new lesions, no active lesions, and some lesions decreasing in size. i love this medicine in that it allows me to be in denial about my ms. prior to starting gilenya, i was on copaxone for 3 years, which was less effective, and during that time i experienced 5-6 immediate post-injection reactions that were scary and exhausting. my neurologist told me that gilenya will change the way we think about ms. i'm looking forward to long term data on gilenya's effectiveness, and enjoying life in spite of my diagnosis. this medicine works for me.	1
111459	day 15 slight headache and insomnia. other then that no side effects, helps if i drink plenty of water, i have severe panic attacks an was nervous about taking harvoni but taking the first pill was the hard part. been a breeze, very excited to complete all meds. update just completed day 28 labs came back virus free yay! dr said take for one more month and done, sleeping much better very excited, if you can't get meds covered call manufacturer for medicine assistance program.	1
15712	i've been taking tarina for 3 weeks. i was not put off by the breast tenderness and the larger cup size and the seemingly constant spotting because my doctor told me that is normal for about 2 months when just beginning a pill. however, i cannot handle the bleak and depressive feelings and moods i have developed. i wasn't perfectly happy before the pill but i've never in my life experienced such depression for so long and i do not have a family history of depression or mood disorders. i do not like to even think of sex anymore, i cry at sad songs, and my school work quality has tanked. i'm glad to know i'm not alone and hopeful i'll feel better soon.	0
89237	to deal with menopausal symptoms: stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, i tried paxil and prozac. not a good result: both very heavy duty - you feel drugged. with prozac i was drooling and i didn't even know it; with paxil, i felt dull-witted and thick, like a beached whale. but the 3rd time was a charm: i tried celexa and it worked almost immediately. i felt calmer, not depressed and i slept like a baby. for me it's the best. the only side effect is one 1/2 hour after taking it i feel nauseous for a few minutes. small price to pay.	1
190344	i was prescribed this birth control about a year ago and i loved it up until about two months ago. i suffer from terrible mood swings and irregular periods. i had absolutely no mood swings until about two months ago. i had regular periods, always on time. weight was hard to lose though. always hungry. but all in all worked perfect. my body must have just gotten used to it.	1
25702	i am on day 6 of wearing the patch for the first time. on the 3rd day, nausea began and it has come in waves everyday since. i also feel extremely tired. i have had moments where i want to rip it off but i have read that the symptoms will lessen if i stick it out. i am 31 years old and have not been on any birth control in at least 13 years and have no children. so at this point, i am going to stick it out a bit longer.	1
230475	i've been on depo for two years. 1st year was rocky with the spotting and mood swings. 2nd year was great. still not pregnant, no more side effects. i take my vitamin c and d. i've gained 3-5lbs, no difference. i've tried the pill and patch and hated them equally for different reason. i would hate to have to switch birth control. i love 4 shots and no babies. its great for me. good luck with your experience.	1
115647	the only thing that has kicked each of the many sinus infections i've had over the years, including the one i picked up in maui and had to fly home with--ended up with a double ear and sinus infection. amoxicillin just won't do it for me.	1
168437	i am laying in bed, vag on fire, can't sleep because of this horrendous medicine. i am on day 3 and i will not finish the full regimen. it is absolutely shameful that the company is marketing and selling his product as is. clearly there's been a change in the formula-- something's not right.	0
158082	this was the worst experience i've had with a medication. i had to go off lithium because it gave me hypothyroidism and diabetes insipidus and geodon was a replacement. i was given geodon at the lowest dose for about two weeks. i was okay, but experiencing a bit of random anxiety. then my dose was upped and i had a panic attack (i've only had 3 of those in my life before) within 24hrs. several days later i was in the er with suicidal thoughts for the first time in 20 years. as far as general effectiveness goes before the dosage increase sent everything haywire, i got depressed right away once totally off the lithium, so it wasn't really helping anyway. the suicidal thoughts and anxiety were gone within 48hrs after i stopped taking it.	0
108215	update: i have been on contrave about 3.5 months and have lost 32 lbs. no side effects. i feel great. the smaller i get, the slower the weight loss is. i also notice if i forget a dose those old bingey cravings come back pretty fast which makes me wonder: will i have to stay on this med longer than i thought? i have 15 lbs left to my &quot;thin goal&quot; and my weight loss has slowed to about 1lb/week. but no complaints here! i look and feel great. and probably 10 people have started contrave after asking me what my secret is ;-)	1
108211	first day on contrave! i picked up my prescription at lunchtime and started it then. within the first hour i was getting a little blurred vision and had a very dry mouth. also my co workers noticed that i stopped talking as much as i was and i was not in as good of a mood. i began to yawn a few times in the first hour. i am usually a high energy person and was just fine earlier so this was odd. by the time 3:00 came around i was begging for me bed. nausea started and was getting bad. i came home instead of working out and passed out for 2 whole hours! i never ever take naps. i'm concerned to take it again tomorrow but i will to see if this gets any better. my dr. said it would give me energy....that is not the case what so ever with me.	0
85393	so, i thought the light periods were a problem but since i see people with the same issue that makes me feel a little better. although, i don't like that i come on at the end of the pack i usually would come on the wednesday during the non- active pills but now its like saturday or sunday, then extremely light for maybe 2 to 3 days. good thing is i do not have problems with the cysts or fibroids now, no pain, periods are once a month although light, no acne, mood swings are normal, i think :-) overall good pill.	1
75909	this is a god send to me! i am currently detoxing from a 6 year (legal) opiate use. over 50 and detoxing is no way to live. the insomnia was the absolute worst thing i was experiencing; 2-2 1/2 hours and watch the clock spin. take temazepam 30mg right before bed and 8-9 hours, with no hangover. what a blessing.	1
2521	i'm 6 weeks into this pill. i have pmdd and treat it with other medication but it makes me sad and depressed even with the other medication. the anxiety is through the roof. this pill makes me so tired. i also have horrible night sweats every night. i also can't sleep. the insomnia is awful. headaches everyday. i have spent the last month trying to figure out what my deal was and its this awful pill. i thought i may of had another condition. the idea of 4 periods a year is amazing but this pill just isn't worth it. i am stopping this pill asap and hoping that everything returns to normal in a few days. oh and the fact that i have completely lost my sex drive! yeah that sucks too. i just want to sleep and not sweat at night.	0
1442	i have used zomig 5mg for years and often one half of a tablet zaps the headache within 15 minutes without any side effects at all. since becoming eligible for medicare my prescription plan has forced me to use the generic sumatriptan. sumatriptan does not work at all for me. i wish i could afford to take my zomig again - it is a wonder drug.	0
130510	the insertion experience was probably the most painful thing i have ever had to go through, and i'm not going to lie about it. i'm an 18 year old who has never had a child, been pregnant or any of the above so my cervix has never been messed with until this moment, which made the procedure ever worse. but, now that it's been about 6 months i can say it was completely worth the experience.	1
109777	i am not sure which impant i got but i am sure it is the nexplanon. i got this may, 2015. i had a period for at least 2-3 months, straight. i have went from weighing 150 to 220 pounds. i have experienced major mood swings, feeling really low about life, horrible cramps, headaches all the time. i still have irregular periods. sometimes i bleed for 2 weeks or more straight or i bleed for 4 days, stop for a day and continue bleeding. sometimes i dont even have a period. everyones body is different and react to birth control differently but i recommend you not get the implant. i had an awful experience with it. i get it taken out in 7 days and i am looking forward to it. i have talked to others and they have a awful experience with it as well.	0
222163	rozerem has little or no effect. woke up several times on rozerem, took one 4 hours ago and am up and not even drowsy.	0
101200	using this as a treatment for yeast infection and skin infection. it has had a remarkable response to the yeast infection but not so for the skin.	1
47025	best thyroid drug for people that have had problems with fillers used in other thyroid medications. this drug has changed my life for the better. i have tried many different thyroid medications and was ill on all of them with many trips to the er because horrible reactions. after 9 years feeling sick with multiple symptoms finally discovered i was allergic to the fillers used in most thyroid medicines. i will say tirosint is stronger than other thyroid meds and i had to drop my usually dosage of 150 to 125 and have had to slowly work my way back up. i think a lot of people that are having problems with this medicine is the fact that they start on their regular dose and it is too high causes hyper symptoms.	1
232232	i just inserted the stuff and about 30mins later i felt a light itching i also had to pee, so after i peed there was a burning feeling that felt like fire and light throbbing in my vagina. feels like satan is skipping inside my vagina it's the worse feeling i have ever had. idk what do this is my first time using it and i'm embarrassed because i'm afraid to tell my bf i have great balls of fire in my vagina.	0
185056	i had hep c for 27 yrs . started harvoni june 3. it was for 8 weeks . got my results of second blood draw today it is still non detectable. thank god and harvoni. i had no side effects. those of you taking treatment hang in there it is worth it. get my last blood draw in january	1
148534	i have had the mirena for 9 months. i was super nervous about having it inserted but it wasn't bad at all. a little uncomfortable but not awful. i bled for about 3 months as expected before beginning to lighten and eventually didn't bleed at all. it was wonderful and i have loved my mirena ever since. however i started bleeding heavily again about a week ago and i'm a little concerned. hesitant to go to my doctor about what seems like a period but i think i need to.	1
31424	if you're here reading this review i hope it's not to late. do not take this. do not buy this. unless you want to feel like your vagina was tortured, raw and burning like hell itself, take my advice. three hours and counting of sheer pain and regret.	0
78193	i take lamictal 300 mg, ambien 10 mg and zyprexa 7.5 mg daily. until the zyprexa was added i still experienced bipolar breakthroughs, insomnia, and extreme anxiety and ocd on a daily basis, which exhausted me. so far zyprexa manages my symptoms, although i haven't been on it very long. i also have food cravings, however no significant side effects. i'm very sensitive to medications, can only take very small doses. what works for me might be too little to help others. my doctor was very surprised to find out that a mere 15 mg zyprexa for emergency breakthroughs would work for me. now i don't need to carry zyprexa with me everywhere, because the nightly dose of 7.5 mg is enough.	1
93277	i have suffered depression all my life but was never prescribed anything for it till june, my wife says my anger and depression was boiling over so i agreed to see my doctor. canadian doctors may be free but they are absolutely useless... alls they do is write prescriptions and push you out the door. took it for two weeks then quit, went back to see my doctor a month later and he had no idea why i was there, after jogging his memory he told me took keep taking it for a year and to come back once a month. that was two months ago my wife still thinks i'm taking this crap lol fooled her. i hide it in a basement drawer. waste of money.	0
51470	we use this at our hospital for patients who are still awake but less than 50 blood glucose level.	1
12848	i have had a very stubborn sinus infection that just won't clear (6 months +). the doctor prescribed 7 days - 30mg of prednisolone. the first three days i felt great. a lot of energy, clearer breathing, better sleep however after then it went downhill fast. my anxiety and panic sky rocketed after a year of being fine. i was shaking, weak legged, dizzy constantly, my heart rate was through the roof (felt like i had drunk 10 coffee's). i had worst sinus pressure and headaches as well. about day 5 it made my sinus problems worse as well, congestion, mucus production was in overdrive! three days off them now and still haven't not calmed down. back to the gp we go :(	0
138118	well basically when i first used it, it was great only have tender breasts felt a little sick but it went away. then all of a sudden i had these terrible mood swings. felt really emotional. and i've been that exhausted, i've had to take naps during the day. so yeah not that good for me.	0
183597	after reading about others' experiences with cymbalta, i was very hesitant to try it. however, i got to a point where i was willing to do anything to feel 'normal' again. i started cymbalta (30mg) about 3 months ago and i am so glad i did. the first week was unpleasant -- i was close to stopping it, but my family encouraged me to give it a fair shot. by the second week things were better. now (still on 30mg) the only side effects that remain are loss of appetite (causing weight loss), occasional vivid dreams, and some difficulty with orgasm. for me the benefits have been huge -- i am able to focus, more energy, no more racing thoughts, no more crying spells, and no more anxiety/panic. everyone is different, but for me this has worked great!	1
88136	so far i have taken 4 pills. i have had some stomach rumbling and a few light pains. i felt a little bit lightheaded a couple of times and a little bit of head pain but other than that its not too bad. my doctor gave me this for an abscessed tooth and i have not had to take any pain medicine today so i guess the clindamycin is already working. i have a little bit of tooth pain but it is bearable. i do eat toast before my first pill and a full meal with the second and something light with the third one. i will check back when i finish the medicine to let you know if things change.	1
125322	i took one dulcolax on sunday and then one on monday for constipation. i was awakened last night at 1a.m. with horrific stomach pain, cramping , nausea, and diarrhea that was like explosive water. all day yesterday, i was going to the bathroon, each time with a little bit of diarrhea. i must have been in the bathroom 25 times. but the pain and nausea i felt last night for hours almost sent me to the er. i kept wishing i could go ahead and vomit so that i'd feel better, but i never could. but the nausea and the pain nearly drove me over the edge. i was in the fetal position for hours (when i wasn't running to the bathroon). i never, ever expected to feel this horrible. never again. i still have sharp pains and watery diarrhea today.	0
94520	abilify made me extremely aggitated about the smallest things that wouldn't normally anger me. the time i was on it i am surprised i didn't end up in prison or a psych ward. one of the worst experiences of my life.. they must have had a good ad campaign for this drugs, because doctors seems to think it is the answer to everything. fact is, the two trials done for the drug before it became the next coming of jesus were done by the drug company who made it. funny thing is, thy didn't hide in their trial that is caused agitation in a little less than half of their patients, which raises the question of why these companies even bother doin trials. they should just sell sugar pills, because it is clear that money was their only motivator...	0
36342	26 spots came out the first week. a few were very big (larger than a pencil eraser) and they oozed like a greenish pus. but....only a tiny bit of itching during the healing weeks. seemed to work great!	1
206713	after taking antibiotics for several years i decided that this was no longer a healthy long term option. after stopping antibiotics my acne came back as bad as ever. i decided to start applying duac gel and have been doing for several months now. after an initial flare up that did eventually die down i have seen absolutely no improvement to my skin. both cystic and minor pimples still appear regularly to the same degree as they did before. very disappointed as i'm willing to give all of my non antibiotic options	0
121332	just started taking venflaxine for my anxiety. it made me very i'll, i was nauseas and vomiting for 2 days. i stopped taking the pill and felt 100% better. i think everyone reacts differently to certain medications, if you are someone with a sensitive stomach just be aware you might have this reaction.	0
13698	i took adderall for approx. 6 years. i started off taking 10mg twice a day. the last year of college i was taking 30mg time release twice a day. i feel that i did benefit from the medication during my last year of highschool and throughout college. my grades were b's and above, and during the first three years of highschool i would jump for joy if i earned a b. so having said that, yes adderall did help with my ability to focus, retain information, and to some degree my determination to complete tasks throughout the day. there was a huge price to pay for taking adderall for as long as i did. my metabolism slowed down immensely and maintaining the same diet and exercise i am 50lbs heavier. doctor told me i would gain 40-75lbs and i did.	1
90499	i have tried it twice already. it did not speed up the healing process both times. it takes 10 days with or without abreva. waste of money.	0
34976	was given levaquin for lingering lung bronchial condition. after 7 days. i was feeling 10x worse. at first i thought i had the flu. headache fever achy all over no energy just weak. then my shoulder joints started hurting so bad i could cry. on a pain score 1-10 i was at a 15 and i've had 4 kids and rods in my back. i contacted the dr who told me to stop taking this medication. that iris known for pain in joints. well i'm 2 weeks out. still in pain all the way down both arms. sleeping on a heating pad and taking pain medication. my original complaint seems minor compared to this. dr says 4-6 weeks to get it out of your system. i am miserable. can't lift my arms.	0
202410	i'm currently between diagnoses of bipolar ii and bpd. i started on 400mg lithium (taking my level to 0.3) and already felt some effects with it. i recently increased this to 600mg and whilst i feel like myself again, i have a few side effects. a lot of nausea, being put off of food, an extreme thirst (which isn't a bad thing because it's important to stay super hydrated on lithium!), minor muscle weakness and stomach issues. when starting and increasing the dose, i became incredibly gassy (thankfully, odourless!) and have had slight stomach upsets. i've also found acid reflux to be a huge symptom for me also, whether it is caused by taking lithium alongside celexa (citalopram) and inderal (propranolol), i'm unsure. overall, great drug.	1
131344	i have been using this finacea 15% gel from about a week, and posting here just because i am totally shocked for the price some of you are forced to pay for this product. i live in italy and i bought this for 19&euro; (full price, no discount) and i thought &quot;that's too much for a tube of gel&quot;. i feel sorry for you, they are extorting you, they are criminals.... can't say anything about the gel yet... too soon for me, but i have acne problem on my skin.	1
20319	extreme nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, joint pain and rash.	0
195091	i started taking restoril last night. i slept a full 8 hrs. i woke up feeling refreshed. aside from the fact that i made a few phone calls in my sleep, i loved it. and it works quickly. i fell asleep in like 20 minutes, great+. hope this helps.	1
16532	so i have been taking this pill for a month and a 1/2 and i'm glad that i will be switching back to lo loestrin fe. this pill was fine for the first month but once it got into my system...oh boy. i'm nauseous all the time, which is only relieved by burping or breaking wind. (gross! i get that it's a bodily function but 24/7?!) i had five days of breakthrough bleeding. my doctor told me it's normal to not get a period after starting this pill. but when you're sexually active, it gives you pause when you don't get one (have not missed a pill). my boyfriend says that my moods have changed and that i'm lathargic when i'm with him. i also get that i'm stressed out with the holidays, but i really don't need my birth control adding to it!	0
131326	i have struggled with acne in my adult life for about a year now. it wasn't that bad, then significantly got worse over the past 6 months. i had huge cyst like pimples and some small ones around my chin mostly and my cheeks started getting bad as well. i tried every single product out there. i finally went to the dermatologist. since i got pregnant a few months ago, my acne got even worse. the dermatologist told me all she could give me was finacea. it's azelaic acid. literally after 2 days, my pimples started to go down and the number of them started decreasing. it stings a bit and itches but it's a small price to pay.. this is a god send and i'm so happy i found it!	1
91607	took my first dose saturday night. wow! what a difference the next morning, i was wide awake, alert and hot to go to my work and my college lessons! as i write this i have been on xyrem for about three months, and recently started having hand tremors occasionally. i noticed that one other person (&quot;anonymous&quot;) mentioned shaking; once in awhile my tremors are strong. xyrem certainly has cured my severe narcolepsy, which began about a year ago without warning. i am glad to see that several people have been on xyrem for years without any adverse side effects, and no withdrawal symptoms when they stopped briefly.	1
30745	. i had my first yeast infection in 2016 but i didn't think much of it so i just ignored it. now i am having another one in august of 2017. so i picked up monistat 7 day treatment. i took a shower, used one of the wipes in the kit then put the applicator in my vagina and applied the cream into my vaginal area. all was fine until i stood up. this is the worst experience i've ever had. my vagina itches and burns really bad. i've tried bouncing around, putting a cool towel on my vagina, fanning the area, patting myself to stop the itching, putting my blanket in between my legs and squeezing my legs together really hard to suppress the itching. the treatment is more torturing than the actual yeast infection.	0
104436	the first week i got levora from planned parenthood was hell. i was a crazy and moody beast, and i ate everything in sight. right now i'm finishing up my second month and it's going way better. the weird food cravings have gone down significantly, although i have gained about 4.5 pounds. the clinician said it would help my acne, but it hasn't really changed yet. although i am really stressed with finals at college, so that may be why. it hasn't really dramatically increased though. but what has dramatically increased is my sex drive. i've never been a very sex driven lady, but now i definitely am and my boyfriend is loving it hahaha. unfortunately it hasn't made my breasts grow though. all in all, i really like it.	1
20494	would be nice to know if it works but can't open it! so many reviews saying how difficult it is to open, and no changes... stupid!	0
225591	i started taking 150mg wellbutrin sr about a month ago to treat severe atypical depression, and it has been nothing short of miraculous for me. the first two weeks were rough. i had some heart palpitations brought on by a combination of the meds and caffeine, so i had to stop the caffeine. i also had to work through a bit of insomnia early on, but that side effect has subsided, and now i actually sleep and wake well rested. for the first time in a decade, i'm hopeful. my negative thoughts are still there, but unlike before, i have control over them. i can manage them in a non-destructive way. words cannot express what it feels like to know that you can, for the first time in so long you can't remember, function as a normal person.	1
122693	linzess is amazing. i was for several years under dip pain.mi tried several doctors and home remedies.. and nothing makes me feel god until my doc prescribe me this wonderful pill.. ho!! thanks god now i have a normal life	1
132312	my experience with a serious panic attack was thought to be the onset of a heart attack. i was monitored, had lab work, even x-rays. no heart attack, my heart was found to be totally clean of blockages. so the doctors conferred that i was indeed having a full scale panic attack. i was given a single 1 mg pill of ativan. within minutes i was calmer, breathing returned to slow and regular, i felt warmer, and secure, clear headed yet a little sleepy. the other med i take is one 75 mg effexor xr nightly, and a single capsule of raw thyroid nightly i do take a vitamin and mineral supplement when i think to. the ativan prescription was issued for short term and serious times of panic only. it was recommended i receive counsel, as well.	1
99629	first time i made it at room temperature with only water mixed in and it took me an hour to gag down the entire 16oz. second time around i found the following to be super helpful: 1) put the suprep in the fridge ahead so it's cold. 2) use cold minute maid light lemonade instead of water 3) add a lemonade crystal light pack to the suprep before adding in the lemonade up to the 16oz mark. 4) stuff your nose with cotton balls! (game changer, folks!) 5) use a straw to get it as far back in your throat as you can 6) bite a lemon wedge after each sip. i was able to get it down in 15 minutes tops with no issues. taste aside, it did the job!	1
198533	i'm taking this by iv for osteomyelitis in my jaw. i have 2 more weeks left but so far so good. no issues. something strange i've noticed that's amazing is my face is very clear. no blackheads gunked up on my nose or chin. it's a wonderful time to allow time for my skin to heal and be clean! does anyone know why this med clears up acne?	1
209743	i just had my second shot 6 days ago. i will admit that my pain from the endo is a great deal better than it was. i was a few days late to get my 2nd shot and could feel the symptoms coming back slowly. the side effects are miserable. i don't want to finish out the treatment. going for a second opinion. will be trying estradiol today, for the hot flashes, which have been the worst, at least 3 an hour, and all night long. haven't had any weight gain so far, weight loss, probably because i am so paranoid about gaining.	0
213659	i had a mild yeast infection with discharge and mild itching. after a few days it became nuisance. i bought the monistat 1 day applicator. within an hour of application the discomfort began and burning followed. i panicked and flushed as much as i could out with water. i called my nurse practitioner and she advised me to discontinue the entire product, including the anti-itch cream/wipes. and to use dove unscented bar soap only, not body wash. i still feel the slight burning, 2 hours later. can't wait for my appointment monday! it's friday today:(	0
101364	throwing mine in the trash!! i've been on aubra for about three weeks. been spotting/bleeding ever since. i have had the worst headache of my life for two weeks straight not to mention the nausea and vomitting. i'd rather just risk a pregnancy. this is ridiculous. i can't even function with daily life.	0
98022	i had this put in on july, 28, 2015 and things have been bad since. this box isn't even big enough to explain it all. i felt great for maybe a week or two then bled constantly until yesterday. then, instead of bearable pain, i now have it pretty bad with nausea. my sex drive is gone and sex is anywhere from uncomfortable to painful. no pain at the insertion site and that went well. my partner has ejaculated inside of me twice and no babies, but it's not worth it. i'm worried about resistance with removing it, but can't take it it's so bad. i'll move to another method once this is cleared out of my system and we'll see where it goes.	0
47259	creatine was recommended to increase muscle tone. i am a female, 5'1&quot; 118 lbs. i took 100mg daily. i quickly developed a horrible body odor. it was described as smelling like i just cleaned an aquarium. unfortunately i could not smell the odor on myself and not everybody was able to smell it, but after anonymous complaints at the gym and finally from a good friend i determined the cause was the creatiine.	0
172286	i take zoloft and the mix was a nightmare!!! it made me more agitated than i normally am ever! beware!	0
55238	i started contrave 11/11/2015 so today would be the end of week 9. i have lost 22 pounds. so that is about 2.4 pounds a week. i have also been eating a healthier diet...south beach. i have not felt deprived and have had the energy to exercise regulary. i have added in workouts 4-6 days a week alternating between run/walk intervals 1 min each for 3-5 miles, 45 minute spinning classes at home through an app called peleton, and hiit style workouts as well on tapes. i am impressed with the energy and focus i have been able to be successful sticking with it. i have not had many side effects....i did try the full dose of 2 in am and 2 in pm at week 4. after a week i was feeling slight chest tightness so backed off to the lesser dose.	1
102324	this medicine is great but it peels my skin	0
165006	this was my first attempt at a prescription for weight loss and i took this from 9/13-3/14. i lost weight and my appetite, somedays forgetting to eat at all. this medicine had a big effect on me that i didn't comprehend while i was on it. i held a high level position and drove multi-states for work. q made it increasingly tough to focus and effected my eyesight and caused some hair loss over time. i couldn't sleep and in addition to not being able to focus, i was exhausted....wired and tired everyday! these things got worse over time. i had dull, almost puffy pain around my eyes everyday, all day long, and my hands and feet were freezing even in hot weather. i was so off-kilter on this...although i lost weight, i felt increasingly awful.	0
221641	after trying omeprazole (prilosec), lansoprazole (prevacid), and other over the counter proton pump inhibitors over the years, i found they were not doing the trick. i had a perpetual sore throat for a few months, and finally went to the ent who said the acid was burning my esophagus. he put me on dexilant, which cured that after about 3 weeks. i stayed on it for a few months, the sore throat went away completely and i never had acid problems after that. this is expensive, but worth it! it is the best thing out there, and the trick to taking it is you have to take first thing in the morning, 30 mins before any food on empty stomach. if you have any food in your stomach, you will get diarrhea.	1
158047	i was only on it for about 3 months! i was on the toilet all day with explosive diarrhea!! i lost 40 to 50 pounds within that time period. my weight was down to 125 pounds. i&rsquo;m 42 years old now. the last time i weighed 125 pounds was in high school!	0
122809	i have been on foradil for years, and have had to find a new replacement as it doesn't seem available any longer.	1
154071	i have not missed a day of treatment and have not seen any change in my nail. i have one more refill to go, so remain hopeful but doubtful i will see any change.	0
39926	i had the same experience as bestyloo who posted on july 28, 2015. however my condition started in may 2015, 1 month after taking the product. the condition is called acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (agep) and is very rare and painful. it takes approximately 1 month to heal. my body was literally burning itself from the inside out. we know for a fact that this condition was a result of the contrave because i was not taking any other medications or otc drugs. for almost 1 month anything that touched my skin was the most excruciating pain imaginable! i saw 4 doctors who all told me i looked like a picture out of a medical book. i sent documentation of this to the company who has yet to respond. stay away from this drug!!!	0
213589	my dear god!!! this is the worst experience my vagina's had since 2011, when it pushed out an 8lb kid!! i'm currently spending the week at a beach resort with my family, and on day 3, realized i was getting a yeast infection from all the time spent in the water. since i'm 10 states away from my dr, i popped into the local pharmacy here to grab monistat 1. as soon as i inserted this monstrosity of a cream, the burning/itching/pain intensified to unholy levels. it's been four hours of hell!! i'm now sitting here in the living room of my hotel, straddling an ice pack, hoping that this stops. my poor poor vagina!!!	0
220300	improved neurological functions, less flare-ups of the autonomic system. helps - body temperature regulation has become a little better, able to sweat a little now, able to swallow now with no problems, hand tremors a majority of the time, and about half the adrenaline rushes than before. does not help - sleep, heart rate and blood pressure, gi problems (gastroparesis, stomach pains, or constipation), heat intolerance, brain fog (memory problems). has had to increase medication a few times, but am still on it. i am still on this medication and would not want to go off this - i have seen improvement.	1
10145	i find it does a good job. i have been on it (on &amp; off) since 2004 for multiple sclerosis.	1
16409	i was switched from genress fe, the birth control i was on for 5 years, to glidess fe 1/20, the pill my insurance would agree to cover. before starting on glidess, i had no mood swings, no acne, and no spotting - even when switched to generic genress. as soon as i started glidess, i began to to get angry over silly things just prior to my period beginning. i also began to break out in acne -a problem that i had not had for about 4 years. then today, i had random spotting even though i've been on the pill for 4 months and am extremely moody (something that was never a problem when on the other pill). to say i'm dissatisfied would be an understatement. i will be calling my ob/gyn to switch the pill tomorrow morning.	0
151941	well only been on it for 8 days don't feel to good and still smoking. my chest hurts, no energy, was up most of last night, and when i do smoke i feel sick so it must be doing something to my body. i pray it starts working because i'm ready to be a non smoker. i do not like feeling sick.	0
175479	i took augmentin starting last week for a sinus infection. the first few days were fine, and i felt relief from the pressure of the infection. however, by day 5, my stomach hurt so badly, and around my body to the back. i could not eat. my stomach was rock hard and i felt so bloated. i could only suffer through day 8. i had to stop. i cannot tolerate this medication, and will never take it again.	0
211691	i've only been taking this for two weeks but i feel a major difference. i am normally super irritable and moody, i feel like this medication has helped me gain the self control to think before i speak. i also feel like it's relieved me of anxiety, when a situation happens i feel so chill. i also am no longer suffering from extreme depression fatigue, i never had energy to help out around the house and i am able to do dishes, laundry etc.	1
192738	my pharmacy switched me from yaz to gianvi a few months ago. i have since gained 18 lbs in that short amount of time. i'm off of gianvi now and noticed that my appetite decreased by half when i quit taking gianvi. i also became more depressed with the medicine. i would just want to lay around all day.	0
91823	i'm feeling terrible. i have been for several tests but no luck	0
141009	i was given lexapro from my gp for anxiety which i had tried to manage naturally the past two years with various techniques to no avail. my panic symptoms were with me everyday and often suffered panic attack episodes. made it extremely difficult to do everyday type stuff let alone work. i was always drug resistant..the kind of person who wouldn't even want to take a headache med so the thought of a drug therapy i would do everyday was scary. anyhow, its early on less than two weeks and i haven't even experience any real side effects apart from a little tiredness first week. i feel less anxious already, no attacks and my thoughts aren't looping in my head anymore. i'm hoping it continues to get better!	1
47714	my face was actually looking pretty good for a while. i wanted to totally clear my face so i got on proactiv md with adapalene gel 1%. so far it has only made my face break out more. i&rsquo;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. what should i do?	0
60027	i tried a couple forms of the pill and found i was allergic, head to toe covered in hives! so my doctor recommended the nuvaring. i've been on it for almost 2 years and it has worked very well! acne went away, no obvious weight gain/loss. its a lot of money, but a lot cheaper than a baby! i recommend this form of birth control to anyone sexually active. easy to remember, just mark your calendar!	1
74578	my doctor had me continuously take loestrin 24 to stop having my period altogether (i have endometriosis), which was great! i was doing well but then i started to feel weird after a while and had gained weight so as an experiment i stopped. i went right back to intensely painful and heavy periods so now i am going right back on it.	1
125860	i take viibrryd for generalized anxiety disorder. i don't have side effects. it works well for me. i had to write an appeal to my insurance to get them to pay.	1
178183	cymbalta works for me, i have symptoms of ptsd and have tried other medications for my anxiety such as: paxil, celexa, and prozac with no good results. so far so good with cymbalta with minimal sexual side effects for me. psychotherapy and physical fitness is recommended if you use this medication.	1
136792	i have had all three shots. i found out that my knee hurts worse than it did before getting the shots.	0
109948	the side effects got worse the longer i was on nexplanon. at first, the side effects were minimal, but by the third month i was getting periods that lasted 10 days and was spotting the rest of the month. it made me extremely emotional and depressed, which became noticeably worse during my periods. also, i had never had any acne during my adolescence years, but ever since i got on nexplanon, my entire face is covered in pimples. like said before, the acne wasn't as bad in the first few months, but got increasingly worse.	0
64732	i promised myself i'd come back to this site and share my experience since it has helped me so much. about four months ago i had my first panic attack, a week after a very serious surgery, my doctor suggested it was from the anesthesia. went two weeks without another one, then boom, full blown panic disorder. i thought i was losing my mind, i had to drop out of school and take off work. went to see a psych who gave me zoloft, started on 25mg (2weeks) then 50mg where i'm at now. i've been at the full dose for 2 months now and i finally feel &quot;that switch&quot; that people talk about go off. the side effects? horrible. if i didn't need to stick with it i wouldn't have. headaches, insomnia, palpitations, excessive yawning. they go away.	1
122570	i have been on opioids for about 5 plus years for chronic pains... after a couple of years of using miralax(joke), and several herbal blends and stool softeners.... i asked my dr for help... he gave me linzess 290mcg ... i've been taking it on an empty stomach in the mornings for 2 weeks, and i haven't even noticed i've taken anything... except for a little bloating. linzess should not be given for oic (opiod indused constipation) as it is useless. i will be asking for something else... maybe relistor? it has preloaded injectables now. has anyone had any experience with it? i'm desperate!!!! the worse my constipation the worse my body pains are. i'm convinced it's related. i have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, neuromyofascial pain,etc.	0
109369	i've had nexplanon for about a year. i hate it. i've had trouble sleeping (too much sleeping) weight gain, constantly having &quot;periods&quot; and i've been extremely moody.. i want it out but i've had the pill, shot and now this. it's not worth it. i just want to feel normal again.	0
114485	im 18, and i've never been on medications before... i have performance- and social anxiety. so when i went to my doctors and asked for something to help me survive my everyday life, he recommended atarax. but i have been taking them for 2 weeks now with no effect what so ever... granted, they are only 10 mg and small as a breadcrumb, but i was at least expecting some effect from it. the only thing i felt was nausea and dizziness.... must say im quite disappointed	0
41632	help with my anxiety by alleviating the nausea and lowered my blood pressure which resulted in less flushing due to anxiety. may have to go a little higher on the dosage to find your sweet spot, but i started at on .1 and went to .2 twice a day and it has really helped.	1
204939	i was on lent's and novalog for 10 years then my dr switch me to ivokana, levimer and victory. the ivokana made me throw my guts up, lose my vision on and off, blood sugar levels spiked to 400 or more, always dehydrated and several other symptoms. i stop taking it. the levimer makes me have several bowel movements daily and i lost 15 lbs but i didn't want to lose weight i only weigh 140. i have lost all my muscle and still craving sugar. i quit taking the victoza because i was sugar spikes were over 300. these medications killing me. they all have me craving sugar, diarrhea and even have me depressed. i only take metformin pills 4 500 milligrams a day.	0
212242	i'm a 30 year old female and i've had many different diagnosis as well. i've tried and failed with many antidepressants, antipsychotics, among others. nothing ever worked or made me feel worse! then i found lamotrigine. i've been on 50mg a day for ten days now. after six days i was feeling great. but now i'm getting mood swings, itchy, slight headaches, and lots of crazy dreaming. i am still a little depressed and thought this is not going to work either. but thanks to all your good reviews i'm going to hang in there, wait until i find the right dose, and hopefully feel as good as all of you.	1
73069	i'm almost done with my 2nd month. i honestly was scared to take this at first after reading the reviews, but it really isn't bad at all. the symptoms are very mild for me, i get some breakouts but its not that bad. i notice some slight change in mood. i can get irritated easy but i notice it and don't let it bother me. the only thing that bothers me is pretty much having another period mid cycle, wasn't really light spotting either. it was done after like 4 days but i know i'm about to start my actual one in about 6 days so that is annoying. i'm going to keep on this for another couple months since the symptoms are so mild and i'll just get more used to them. all i can say is i love free birth control!	1
210451	i developed constipation when i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and diverticulosis 2 years ago. i currently have samples from my gastro dr. but prescription with my insurance it's $30. i was very constipated this morning and decided today was the day to try one of the samples. you have to take this medicine on an empty stomach. popped pill, made breakfast and felt movement before i finished eating. thought i would have diarrhea, but instead was smooth and normal. what a relief. it was about 30-40 mins from time i took pill to bowel motion. i think i will go fill my prescription now. hope the rest of the day goes well and no side effects. i do hear mild gurgling. also, i did add powdered fiber to my coffee because i made it before i decided to take medicine.	1
82995	i've been on paxil for 4 days and so far i have been staying up late, had a sore throat for few days and also been eating a lot. as far as my moods, i haven't felt any changes or anything as far as pulling me out of my depression shell. as far as i know, it doesn't start actually working until about 4-6 weeks.	0
142195	i took plan b within 24 hours after unprotected sex. a few weeks later i got side effects that i figured were from the pill, but they were similar to pregnancy symptoms as well. i didn&rsquo;t stress about it much, then when my period was late i figured it was another side effect. 10 days of my period being iate and finally took a test, positive. i got pregnant even though i took plan b within the 24 hour span. maybe i was ovulating too closely. i think this medication does not work if you&rsquo;re ovulating or about to ovulate. keep that in mind.	0
99357	apparently a side effect not reported is that the metabolic by-product of doxylamine will possibly test positive in a urine drug test as an amphetamine. it is not listed in the literature so i had a hard time explaining it when it was the only medicine i had taken before a job drug test.	1
75869	even small (half) doses of temazepam effectively helped me to get to sleep and stay asleep for an appropriate amount of time. however, it consistently caused me to have feelings of irritability and aggression for the following 24 hours. i found myself growing angry and frustrated, expressing this in ways that are very out of character. i do not usually express anger overtly, perhaps becoming teary instead, but temazepam inhibited my self-control and caused me to speak out aggressively in very unfamiliar and unhelpful ways. i put added stress into family life and had a very dangerous effect on my relationships. i only took temazepam in reduced doses intermittently (e.g. 1 or 2 doses per week) and the impact was consistently bad the next day.	0
71420	i have been using lamictal for years. recently my dr added vraylar and i won't lie the first couple days were horrible!!! i got so sick but i pushed through and the results have been amazing and i've had only taken it a week. i am diabetic and haven't had high blood sugar, no wait gain although i was sooo hungry the for the first couple days. if you can push through the side effects i highly recommend this medicine. i feel alive again i have energy and just look forward to life. also the voices and visions have stopped	1
207193	i've gotten cold sores for years. i've had some disfiguring experiences with larger ones that scab over on or around my lips. they started in my 30's and over thirty years, have always been with me. sometimes i go for 7-8 months without being affected but they never cease completely. there are times when i get one, it runs its course for about 10 days, then in a week or two, get another that can be more severe. generally, it works well. although it is still effective at controlling an outbreak and reducing healing time, it is far from a cure and outbreaks can still result in blisters even when taken a.s.a.p. after first signs. timing is important. take at first tingle is a good rule but if outbreak occurs during sleep, not much can be done.	1
124766	3 months back doctor told me that my cholesterol levels are slightly on higher side and need to start medication if the levels are same after three months. insteadi started taking efa icon krill oil a couple months back. today i got my lab reports and its normal: hdl - 51 ldl - 104 total cholesterol - 189	0

177139	this is the only nasal spray that i've used over the last 25 years. i hope the product never gets discontinued. it is effective with minimal side effects. i don't leave home without it - ever. it's a good product. as with all nasal sprays, overuse will get you addicted. just use it twice a day as directed and it will be effective.	1
77965	my 10 year old daughter started experiencing acne very suddenly and was getting teased at school. i took her to the dr who prescribed retin a .025%. after a month there was not much improvement so she also started doxycycline. a month later we started noticing significant improvement. now it's been 2 1/2 months on the retin a and about six weeks on the doxycycline and she is so happy, as am i. she still gets pimples here and there, but the huge patches of acne on her forehead and cheeks are gone. her face is sensitive to the sun and gets red at times, but we will take the pink cheeks over the acne any day!! my advice is to be patient. it gets worse before it gets better!	1
151455	4years quit, after 30 years smoking. i really didn't even want to quit, but took it on my physician's advice. smoked while taking it for 7 days (day #4 i could tell it was working good). quit and took for 7 more days &amp; never had an urge. i could be right next to someone smoking, after i ate, while drinking &amp; not ever feel the urge to return. no side effects, except maybe slight nausea first two days.	1
15879	i've been having terrible side effects from this pill so googled it and found these reviews which are exactly what i've been experiencing. i'm craving bad foods, gaining weight, my boobs are tremendously sore, i'm tired and i haven't had a period. i've been on many other birth controls that i had no side effects on so i will be switching back to altavera asap!	0
106456	so, my experience with the implanon (nexplanon) implant was adventurous, to say the least, and not in good way. the second week of insertion, i felt like i was pregnant. literally, from food cravings to nausea. i felt light headed from time to time. and mood swings, oh the mood swings! but at that point in time i didn't think anything of it. i figured it was just my body's way of adapting to a new medicine. whatever. a couple months later, i talked to my doctor about getting back on my depression medicine...no big deal. i've been depressed most of my life. side note that i though was pretty cool: over time i noticed a day before i started my period the area that the device was located would feel a burning pinching sensation... much cle	0
138119	i love the patch. i'm 17 and i use it to regulate my periods. they used to be very irregular and long and now they come like clockwork. they're kind of heavy but they only last 4-5 days which is so nice. the first week of the patch i felt pretty nauseated and i had loss of appetite, but after that i was fine. no nausea, no headaches, and my breasts got bigger. the only problem is that i'm extremely emotional. i overreact and cry a lot, especially before/during my period. overall, though, the patch is great, and way easier than the pill. i recommend it.	1
214290	i haven't had a yi in about 4 years. i wear tights &amp; a small outfit for work, so it made the pain 3x worse. i wanted it gone asap, so when i seen the 1 day application i decided to give it a try. i did it at night. it did burn a little but, not where i was crying or anything like that. just to make it where i couldn't sleep because of the discomfort. next morning all of it had seeped out &amp; the discharge consistency from the yi had already started to lighten. the creme soothed the outside so much more. didn't itch or burn or anything. everyone's body is different. so i say if u are the type of person who can handle pain then do it, if not do the 7 day monistat.	1
1551	i have severe copd and started taking daliresp approximately 2 years ago. my pulmonologist suggested daliresp as i was experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring 2 to 3 hospitalizations a year. i am taking 2 different inhalers a day and on 4% oxygen 24/7. for the past 2 years i have been hospital free! yah! i wish the daliresp wasn't so expensive or a generic were available, but then again no hospitalizations (which is the last place a sick person should be).	1
100009	i was on reclipsen for less than 2 weeks and it caused blood clots. i had dvt and pulmonary embolisms. i'm one of the lucky ones that lived through those diagnoses. i had taken other bc on the past and always had terrible side effects but never had an issue with clots. i also have no other contributing factors besides being overweight. i was 26 and never smoked in my life. no genetic issues either. i advise everyone to be careful when considering any birth control option. know the signs of blood clots. it could save your life.	0
26466	about 4 1/2 years ago i had surgery to remove a corpus luteum cyst and another cyst that burst. since then i have been on sprintec with no other cyst relates problems. i have no mood swings, nausea, depression... basically no negative side effects except from a little weight gain. i can't complain about that.	1
56347	i'm 52 years old and have had psoriasis since i was 5. i went on humira a few years ago and stayed on it for 3 years. it cleared me about 98%. i called it a miracle! i decided to make some nutritional changes in my life for the better and went off humira 6 months ago to see what difference my better eating habits may have made on their own. unfortunately my psoriasis came back just as bad if not worse than before the humira. i think i will be going back on it.	1
130350	i had a bit of pain with insertion (i did it at the wrong time of the month in order to get it covered by insurance), but after that it has been wonderful. i had spotting instead of periods for the first few months, and then my periods stopped completely. i have had it for a little over two years and no longer have any bleeding or cramping from periods. i am extremely happy i chose to get it.	1
211894	i was off medication for about one year while seeing a therapist when i decided to seek out a psychiatrist and try again. i explained to my psychiatrist that i feel as though my depression is secondary to my mood instability and the problems it continues to cause in my personal life. i said i didn't feel comfortable trying another anti-depressant due to prior bad experiences (self-harm, suicidal thoughts, etc). he suggested a mood stabilizer (lamictal/lamotrigine). i started out at 50mg, then 100mg, 150mg, 200mg.. honestly, it did nothing for me. if anything, i feel like it increased my symptoms. long story short, i ended up in the er two days ago due to a self-induced overdose.. would never try it again, but just my personal experience.	0
121207	i have been on this medication for 2+ years. i would not recommend a dosage higher than 37.5mg a day at 200lbs male. it keeps me awake and not having adhd type symptoms throughout the day if i take it in the morning. i have tried prozac and it only made my symptoms worse not better. as a night person who had sleeping cycle problems from a young age.	1
30546	bought miconazole 3 tonight. used one applicator and the burning sent me to search the internet for answers beyond what the paper insert in the box could provide. the burning is not severe but it is just as irritating as the actual yi. i hope it (the burning) eases up because i doubt i'll do doses 2-3 if it doesn't.	0
69240	first one i took my heart was racing i thought i just had to get use to medication.second one the same the third one i had a severe allergic reaction ended up in the hospital thought i was going to die.i would not recommend anyone ever take this terrible medication.	0
198322	started byetta in mid october 5mgs at first. moved on to 10mgs from mid november. i almost finished that pen now but i have had no nausea or any other side effects, no weight loss, no difference in my food intake, no diff in my sugar levels. #sad face.	0
51841	i'm 38 ive been on stelara for 6 years and i was 80 % covered. within 6 months i was 95% clear. the only draw back is it doesn't work on my scalp and my fatigue over the years has gotten worse. some days i don't even want to move.	1
181372	so i have tried prozac for depression to major depression disorder a little bit of obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic disorder.firstly it made me more anxious and agitated about a month later me and my dr upped the dose to 40mg.nothing,unfortunately happened,probably wasn't the right drug for me,i have switched to lexapro now and it is too soon to give opinion on it as ive only been for 3 weeks.in conclusion this drug (prozac) wasn't effective for me.only about 3/10 i would say.	0
197761	this medicine gave me more energy and improved my mood, but it made me quick tempered. it made it hard for me to function without having extreme emotional ups and down.	0
61655	i experienced almost instant positive effects. i was easy going again and life didn't seem so hard. the mountains were scaleable. only side effect was clenching my teeth. i can live with that! i stopped getting cranky with my kids, which was something i hated doing, so that was the best side effect!!	1
159926	i started taking this a few weeks ago and my acne is almost 100% gone. my skin feels very soft and smooth as well. it is definitely worth a try. i was on monocycline before for about a year and my acne began to relapse. once i started on bactrim my skin was clear again but i am scared of relapsing since it is still an antibiotic. drink lots of water as well because you constantly feel dehydrated.	1
174244	scalp psoriasis spread uncontrolled for over 2 years, it was unbearable! less than a week on this medication, and it's almost completely cleared up. the price is high, but the results are worth it. no negative side effects.	1
201806	i have taken casodex for years and psa stays around 3.7. no operation. side effect is enlarged breasts. now 79 years old and swimming a mile a day. feel strong and doing well.	1
7212	i just tried this product on yesterday right before i went to bed and it did sting a little but nothing really and what can i say...it really worked way better then secret clinical strength.	1

23300	i would be dead if not for methadone and the clinic. i will never forget the people there that helped me. i was dying they saved me from pills. i thank them every time i'm there.	1
82759	i started taking maxalt after horrible experiences with imitrex. i had almost all the same side effects: extreme nausea, dizziness, falling asleep, and a general out of it feeling the rest of the day. but the worst part is that it did absolutely nothing for my migraine. i am just glad that i had samples so i didn't get stuck paying for a prescription i would not use.	0
193250	i was prescribed the 10 mg tablet and made me completely useless. i was so groggy and sleepy all i wanted to do was sleep. i had my dr. reduce to 5 mg. still groggy, sleepy. i took one last night because my neck was stiff and my back hurting and i hadn't taken one in a while. i slept ok, but had difficulty getting up. once the initial rush of work was over at 10, all i wanted to do was sleep. i went online to see if there were similar experiences, and it appears that in general, this is what to expect from this narcotic. mild headaches accompany the sleepiness and lack of focus. so does dry mouth. now im just waiting for it to wear off so i can be back to normal...	0
51881	i am 41, i have had psoriasis since i was 3 and was misdiagnosed from the beginning as anything from warts to cradle cap. i've used cole tar, all of the lights(including puva), steroids, vitamin d, diet, chinese herbs, acupuncture and methotrexate ( probably more i can't remember). i have never been more clear than i am now. i've had no side effects that i am aware of and couldn't be happier. i was afraid of biologics, but i should have embraced them sooner	1

229821	i was recently taken off of lithium for bipolar because of my thyroid problems. i am very happy with latuda. it works quickly and makes me feel normal for the most part. i have only had a little irritability, but it quickly subsided. the main problem i have had with latuda is drowsiness. i take it at night, but am still having a difficult time waking up. i'm going to try taking it earlier, like right after dinner, and see if that helps me wake up earlier. i have to wake up by 6:00 a.m. once school starts again since i am a teacher. i have been waking up around 10:00 a.m., and don't think that will work. i recommend trying latuda!	1
197631	the taste is so bad i had to try to keep from throwing most of it back up. why in the world would they add that awful &quot;fruity&quot; flavor?? miralax doesn't taste like anything, take note sureprep! seriously some of the most disgusting flavored stuff i've ever had the misfortune of drinking. vomited some of it back up but luckily got most of it down. it worked to clear things out but at what cost? just spent 4 hours walking around my living room trying not to throw up! i'll go back to the old method thank you. expensive and disgusting!	0
198912	i wanted to go on the shot because the ease of only having to go to the doctor every 3 months and the chance of not having periods anymore were really attractive to me. so far ive only gotten my first shot and i can say without a doubt that i never want to go back for my 2nd one. i have had nonstop bleeding for two months. i cant have sex because i bleed too much which is ridiculous since the reason i got the shot was to have sex! my doctor never explained just how much people actually bleed on the depo shot and how common it is! if i knew id bleed everyday consistently for months on end i wouldve ran out of that office! i can only hope these symptoms will go away once the final 3rd month is over....	0
227177	i got this 4 weeks after my daughter was born and since i've had it my depression has hit the fan, i've got uncontrollable migraines. after november 2013 i had a period every other day and it only lasted an hour, not to mention i have gained 60lbs and my doctor refuses to remove it.	0
158036	had a lumpectomy for stage i advanced breast cancer followed by radiotherapy. then was put on each of the aromatase inhibitors, letrozole and the other one. basically i was unable to continue either after 10 days due to increasingly debilitating dizziness, nausea, crying, etc. then put on tamoxifen, and i developed lymphodoema. so tamoxifen was discontinued but still have moderate lymphodoema. then put on aromasin. initially able to tolerate it but increasing light-headedness (four minor car accidents) and debilitating joint pain (everywhere), poor sleep somewhat countered with lyrica. i had already been diagnosed with widespread arthritis in the joints and the pain with aromasin has been intolerable so discontinued, against medical advice.	0
129660	i am 21 with no kids i got it inserted april 7th and the insertion was pretty painful, but manageable, don't let the fear of insertion stop you from getting it because it only lasts about five minutes. the worst part for me has been pretty much nonstop bleeding and constantly being bloated, i gained about five pounds since i got it. i had a normal period the first month, but i have been bleeding ever since june 9th, the nurse said it was normal, but i have become anemic because of it. i also now have cysts on my ovaries which may or may not be related to the mirena, but they are painful and i have to go back to check on them. i'm still not sure if i made the right decision with mirena i mean i'm not pregnant, so it's doing what i wanted.	1
124318	never pregnant,28,retroverted small (6cm) uterus. my regular period = severe cramping,vomiting,heavy bleeding,miss work. skyla recommended to decrease cramping w/ low hormone side effect risk. negative past experience with other hormonal bcs (nuvaring:extreme fatigue,combo pills:visual migraines,pops:super depressed &amp; anxious). insertion was extremely painful but quick. barely noticeable cramps for 2 days, pain-free after (but vag dryness). after 1 wk, started having excruciating pain caused by laying/sitting(back,stomach,pelvic,upper thigh cramps that woke me from sleep every 3-4 hours,lasting several hours);600mg ibuprofen no help, slow walking did. 4 days of this,removed (mild pain &amp; quick). relief was immediate. ppgyno said this was a first in her experience	0
9775	my dr decided to switch me to this bc just to try a different kind because i had a headache every period. well took this pill for 4 days. i felt awful. i woke up feeling hungover every morning, headaches, dizziness. almost fainted at work. so i called my dr and switched right back to my previous bc. and it's been over 2 months since this and i've lost a lot of hair ( and i mean a lot!!!!!! )	0
194497	69 year old male. new to statins. have started on atorvastatin and in the first 80 days, with no side effects, cholesterol has dropped from 258 to 179, ldl to 100, and ldl/hdl ratio to 2.2. so... success! very pleased.	1
149117	got my iud inserted toward the end of my period on july 6th. i just had a baby in march and it took me almost 3 months to start my period. insertion wasn't too bad. felt a little pinching but that was it. i did bleed after insertion that that lasted about 2-3 days. after that i started having really bad abdominal pain to where i needed to take ibuprofen all the time. the bleeding did stop after the 3rd day of insertion but then on july 19th i started to bleed heavily and have not stopped since. so basically for these past 3 weeks i have either had sever abdominal pain or heavy bleeding. i'm really not liking this at all. it's irritating to have to go through what seems like an extended period. considering in having it removed!!	0
126680	this medicine has been life changing. it is the only medication that i found that has managed my headaches.	1
174834	i was a corpsman with a 2nd marine infantry battalion, and i was wounded in iraq by an ied, i broke 2 vertebrae in neck, 2 in back, 5 herniated disc's, a lot of nerve damage and shrapnel. i was wounded january 8,2008 and have been on percocet 10mg for 6 years and have had over 60 surgeries and 200 injections and physical therapy. i have had no relief from pain. i had thought about suicide because i hurt so bad. so i quit my pain dr and went to another. he looked at all my documentation of injuries and treatments. he said simply on my first day &quot;you have paid your dues, i'm going to give you 30 12mg exalgo er a month with 120 oxycodone 10mg for breakthrough pain. i have only taken for 4 days the exalgo and i feel no pain.	1
57296	i have been on opana er 15mgs for 3yrs now. was diagnosed with a herniated disc with an annular fissure at l3,4 and 5. also have degenerative disc disorder, spinal stenosis, plus more back problems and diagnosed with fibromyalgia. all i can say is the opana er crush resistant are junk. i was prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride er 15mg a green pill, the pill form was a miracle for me i could get up and go to work 12-16hrs and they last with hardly taking a percocet for breakthrough pain had my life back with the generic. the name brand opana er are junk. i always have an empty stomach when i take and not even an hr later my stomach is upset and always have diarrhea.	0
154538	i have been taking 8mg suboxone for 2 years and switched to bunavail because myinsurance would cover it. i am switchng back after taking it for 2 weeks because 4.2 mg of bunavail does not equal 8mg of suboxone regardless of what the manufactor claims. i started feeling bad around day 4 of taking it and have not felt better. i would not recommend switching to this brand.	0
64665	zoloft is an excellent medication for treating obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety..all of which i have. ever since i started taking it i have been so much happier and worry free. however i am 24 years old and i enjoy to go out to the bar with my friends..and let me tell you. if you want to drink on this medication, be advised that it will completley cancel the drug out. everytime i drink i have severe anxiety the next day. but other than that i would recomend this drug	1
70830	i've had major constipation mainly from taking iron pills and a bad diet. was in the er with excruciating stomach pains (worse then kidney stones) and the doctors couldn't figure out the problem. when they told me it was constipation i didn't believe them but took the bottle they gave me and used it at home. within 5 mins it worked and pain was gone. i'll never go to the er with stomach pains again without first trying this method. works like a charm!	1
185830	on november 18th i started saxenda i'm now into my fourth week of the injections and i am happy to report i have lost 20 lbs. finally a medication that works in the fight against obesity. constipation can be an issue but i find i can keep things moving, lol, by taking one senokot twice daily. i had very few side affects that only lasted a few days. however i do find if i eat too much i get a stomach ache that only lasts a few minutes. i love this drug! i will probably be on it for a few years. good luck to anyone who is considering this drug.	1
40524	i hate this pill. i've been on different pills before and i have never felt like this. i'm throwing up all the time. my appetite has increased heavily. my acne has never ever been this bad. i'm tired all the time and i just feel like shit since taking it. i've been on it for three month now and every new pack is just a horror story. i get a very very light period which really pisses me off. i get it for one day. i hate that i'm the type of person who freaks out if that happens. it makes me so uncomfortable and nervous to basically not get a period. my ob won't change the pill and i'm so fed up with it. i have no motivation at all. i never felt this was before taking this pill. i hate it.	0

194648	have been taking this for almost 9 months as other injections failed to work for me. it started out good but a few months into using it i developed severe night sweats. i am coping with it for now as the side effects from other multiple sclerosis medicines were much worse.	1
208509	after reading all positive reviews i was extremely hopeful but after 3 rounds still nothing..	0
149432	i have felt so wonderful since i had the mirena inserted over a week ago - i feel like my old self! i have suffered for over a decade with huge fibroids, have been through two major open surgeries, multiple minor ones, have had horrendous periods, pms through the roof, you name it - i've had it. this past week i have been energetic, happy, smiling and just plain normal!! i haven't felt like this for years and i can only assume my body is responding well to it. i hope my positive experience stays. i had it inserted under general anesthetic as my gyno did a hysteroscopy while she was in there.	1
122111	i was prescribed effexor after a major depressive episode and being diagnosed with general depressive disorder. i started at 75 mg of the xr and a few weeks later increased to 150. i can't even tell you how much better i felt. i know that some people have problems with this medication, but that's how it is with any anti-depressant. the only side effect i had was increased sweating, which was annoying, but was definitely outweighed by the positive effects. the only issue i had with this medication was a decrease in effectiveness over time. eventually i had the dosage raised to 225 mg and i stayed with that dosage for a year and haven't had any problems.	1
135472	well, 7 weeks pregnant and diagnosed with tonsillitis and influenza. tamiflu caused me to have continuous projectile vomiting for 3 hours after taking it. i had to discontinue treatment and ride the flu out. body is handling the amoxicillin fine though for the tonsillitis.	0
95555	i have not noticed any effect from bontril at all. no side effects, no reduction of hunger, no energy. it's as if i never even took anything. i have lost a couple of pounds but that is because i am eating very healthy and really cutting back but i am starving all the time. i'm not sure i will be able to make it this way.	0
46377	after the first 200mg dose, i experienced a powerful, irresistible and complete voiding of my bowel. it left me weak so i did not take any more for a full day. then i took half a tablet (100mg) and experienced the same thing again. at a quarter dose (50mg) the same thing happened. i think provigil is an excellent laxative. it gave (at all those doses) a moderate improvement in wakefulness for about two hours; it did not help with my cataplexy. since then 40mg (4 x 10mg) of methylphenidate allows me to stay awake and alert and also eliminates attacks of catalepxy.	0
17297	i've been on progestin-only birth control for about 3 years. i started on ortho-micronor, i had a period for about 3 months straight but then my period stopped entirely. then i moved and i was given camila (same thing, different brand), it kept in line with the &quot;no-period&quot; havingness. it was great. moved again, i was given errin. for about 2-3 months i was ok, but i noticed some changes in my mood and some bloating. then about 3 months in (february 2014) i had spotting. i thought maybe it would be normal after having no period for 2 years, but then 2 weeks later i had a full-on period. since then i've had maybe 3-4 periods in 2 months, extremely painful tenderness in my breasts.	0
11741	i have had no problems with trulicity other than weight loss. i have been taking the injectable .75 for 8 weeks now with absolutely no problems. i'm not sure of my a 1 c as they are doing it february 10th. i have found i have absolutely no appetite and have to force myself to eat or even remember to eat as i always seem to have that &quot;full&quot; feeling. dr also has me on the once a day dose of januvia and glipizide. i'll update on my a1c when it's checked again. thank goodness for my insurance paying anything that has to do with diabetes, as between trulicity and januvia, it would break the bank!	1
199690	the pills can make you feel like shit but you won't want a ciggy! cravings almost never happen , it's so strange. when i tried to quit on my own all i thought about was the next smoke. now i'm like a butterfly! i'm a month in and i want to stop because today i took a while pill and i'm feeling like throwing up! and headaches! but the smell of cigg does nothing for me. my pharmacist wants me to continue in case i'm just being cocky. i'll start to take half a pill now on and see how that goes!	1
91455	this drug made me feel worse . it intensified my bladder spasm and gave me extreme rectum pain . my insides feel like they are being sucked in. don't think that because it's more expensive that it's better . it's crap . better to take nothing . and i only took one pill . never again .	0
39311	i have been taking contrave for since 01/19 and have lost 11 lbs. my only side effects have been mild constipation and a occasional shakiness mostly in the mornings but other than that i feel great. i have cut all bread and sweets from my diet and walking at least 4-5 days a week. before cutting out the bread and sweets i had pain in my knees and other joints but the pain has subsided. contrave has given me the willpower to make better food choices. it costs me around $90 but compared to the health benefits of losing this weight it's worth it!	1
101488	methotrexate was damaging my lungs (fibrous complications) so my rheumatologist put me on 5mg. xeljanz twice daily. the humira/methotrexate combination i was using previously worked very well for me except for the lung problems. i've been using the xeljanz for about a month and it's not been good. my hands and feet hurt a lot more and all the time. i see my doctor in a couple of weeks so i'm hoping he can come up with something more effective.	0
82242	i tried this drug 3 different times within 2 months. the first 2 weeks were great and then i had vomiting and diarrhea. i tried the drug 2 more times and each time, at the lowest does, extreme vomiting and diarrhea. i lost 10 pounds my first 2 weeks, which was great and it really did reduce my appetite. if this didn't make me so sick, i would still be using it.	0

230964	savella has helped with my muscle pain, frequency of migraine headaches, brain fog and energy. i haven't really had any major side effects. this medicine has helped me more than anything i've been prescribed so far....and that is a pretty long list!	1
23750	after 3 years on synthroid (mostly bedridden), then 2 years on combination thyroxine/cytomel which got me up out of bed and moving around. then, finally, 2 months ago, ofter 5 years of suffering, i was switched to wp thyroid (desiccated (dried) thyroid )and i have my live, my energy, my libido, my brain back, and any number of aches and pains throughout my body are gone. why wasn't i offered this on day one?	1
65396	beware the devil pill!! the utmost worst experience of my life on yasmin. the first month was ok..... continued to take it, up until the third month i started to see the side effects creeping through. my hair was falling out and i began to get very thin lining on the top of my scalp which is horrible!!! and looks horrible too. my anxiety was at its worst i gained at least 10 kilos within four months of being on this pill and was recommended by my doctor to take it as it is one that most likely you wouldn't gain weight on i guess all bodies are different. however... the 5/6th month of being on this pill was the worst time of my life.... my depression was so high and strong and i felt as though i could not function at all! don't recommend it	0
50110	gabapentin has been great for reducing my hot flashes! i was prescribed this medication after chemotherapy for nerve pain. it stop the nerve pain in my hands and feet. it also helped with restless leg syndrome.	1
103371	i still have to take advil, or aleve in addition to celebrex.	0
208722	got some notable relief from bursitis pain in the shoulder but side effects became unbearable an hour after each dose. lightheadedness upon standing, fatigue, abdominal nausea and cramping. dr. changed to prednisone 20mg with immediate results and no side effects.	0
191845	i have tried typing a response and recommendation for this medication but keep running out of space. in short, this drug absolutely changed my life. as adults, we all remember certain days in our life, i.e., our first kiss, graduation, birth of a child, getting married, etc. i will always remember saturday, december 8, 2007 as the day where my life changed because of vyvanse. the only side effect for me was a complete loss of appetite for about a month. but in my case, that's not such a bad thing! i was taking 50mg for about 6 months and now have taken 70mgs for the last 16 months.	1
57384	i have been on pain medicines for over 10 years. i've tried it all. i was taking oxycodone 2 x 80mg plus 2 x 40mg plus 6 roxicodone 30mg a day. my pain doctor switched me to 2x40 plus 2x20 opana plus with the same roxicodone a day. this helped some. i had built up a tolerance to oxycodone. last month she changed the roxicodoen to 4x10mg opana for break through pain. now i have my life back. this is the first time in years i have been able to get up and get around. i have had a pain pump before and was going to get another one but after this switch as of now i don't need it. if opana is not working you may need a higher dose if you are able to take it. don't give up.	1
85809	i am so happy with sprintec. i had a horrible experience with lo loestrin fe. i change doctors and he prescribed sprintec. so far no side effects. i've only noticed some breast tenderness and mild acne. it's working great for me!	1
203616	in my 3rd week of taking zyban. i smoked as usual for the 1st 2 weeks 1 pack a day. slowly i started smoking less frequently and only half a cigarette at a time. i am now not smoking at all and more importantly i dont even think about smoking. i have trouble falling asleep at night....but so far thats the only side effect i am experiencing. i am finally on the road to being a non smoker for the 1st time in 24 years.	1
111641	got my urinary tract infection at 10pm and within an hour i knew i was in trouble with the usual stinging and need to go to the bathroom but it happened so fast and before i knew it i was bleeding quite heavily. immediately went to emergency and was prescribed cipro, within an hour i was getting relief. i'm dizzy and have ringing in my ears but very relieved the pain is subsiding, hopefully the bleeding will stop soon.	1
180756	awful experience. took natazia for 5 days and became so depressed and anxious. i would start crying for no reason and have serious mood swings and feel very irritable/annoyed at everyone around me. my vision became very blurry and my eyes were more dry than normal (i have contact lenses). i was nauseous most days and felt very bloated. my migraines came back full force. i do not recommend this pill at all.	0
139370	i have sleep apnea and use the c-pap but still felt so tired and my mind did not work. my sleep dr. prescribed nuvigil 150 mg. it was and is a miracle pill. i have taken it for 11 months. i feel like a new person with so much more energy. i deal with diabetes type 2, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, acid reflux and depression. i am not over-weight and am the only one in my large family with these problems but nuvigil has helped me to cope much better. i was worried about it becoming habit forming and having to take larger and larger doses. but i only take 1/2 tablet in the morning usually. if i am going to be busier than normal, sometimes, i take the other half at lunch. but not often. it is still my miracle pill.	1
10282	my allergist put me on aerospan for a month it wasn't working i was still tight. the same day i started breo i felt relief it will be 2 months on april 10th have not used my rescue inhaler more than twice in 2 months [used to use it to 6 times a day] the only side effects i have are severe all day chest pain and back pain. fatigue i feel super tired and unable to walk to much but no exerbation from my lungs iifeel shortness but my lungs are clear. my pulse is over 120 resting and as high as 165 at times had to take ativan to relax the palputations im 29 yrs old my dosage is 200/25mg along with montelukast 10mg.	1
206608	gave me the speed jitters, irritable, and still tired and sleepy only now i'm grumpy too.	0
73081	took this medicine for about two weeks and experienced mild stomach cramps, nausea, and gas. happy to be off!	0
122288	i have tried several medications for my major depression over the years and emsam side effects have, by far, been the smallest. there are no sexual side effects, no weight gain, etc. my moods are not &quot;monotone&quot; like i had felt on some of the other medications. the only drawback to this medication, in my opinion, is the food/drink watch. i personally don't have to modify much, but if you drink a lot or eat a lot of aged foods, this will be an issue for you on emsam. also this is an maoi so there are medication interactions as well. but mood wise, depression, anxiety...this is the best ever!	1
153259	hey it's the high school student, and i'm on my 3 week. omg my skin has been clearing up, my friend has told me the difference, i still have loads left but i've just began to third week and i can see that the cystic acne has cleared up, i'm never gonna give up.	1
37109	5.5 weeks into 12 week course of zepatier for gt4. the first week, i had some weird aches and pains and could not tolerate alcohol (not a big drinker but after a few sips of wine, i got really unwell - not had a drink since). apart from some fatigue, there has been no other side effects. however, the fatigue is lessening each week and i have been able to work and maintain a normal life throughout. after 4 weeks, blood results show all lfts are well within normal range. hcv &amp; vl not tested since starting treatment. it looks like it's working :) keep you posted!	1
229448	horrific experience. was only on it for 1 week (40mg). muddled thoughts, numb tongue, restlessness, severe insomnia, nausea.	0
108567	in the first 3.5 weeks i lost 12 lbs. my doctor said it could be an anomaly and not to be upset if the next 5 weeks don't show this type of weight loss. the first 2 weeks i felt no different and then it kicked in and i stopped thinking about food and my appetite really decreased. side effect is constipation for which i take a metamucil and it is working. my total weight loss since being under doctor care is 38 lbs. i was on another med, but broke out into an uncontrollable itchy rash and had to stop. i encourage people to keep at it (contrave) because it does take time to see any difference/results.	1
24059	i have been lucky to have very clear skin all of my life. when i turned 50 i started to get minor breakouts on my forehead and around my mouth. i was already seeing a dermatologist for something else, but she sent me home with a script for 1% tretinoin. i had the angry dry skin that looked like my face was peeling off, that lasted a few months, so i started mixing it with my night serum and that made all the difference. 6 months of use i started using my cleanser and that's when i really began to see results. i'm 53, my pores are tight, my rosacea is non existent, and i have had no breakouts in months. my 45 gram tube has lasted the first year and it's not even empty, but i just refilled again at costco, best price i've found.	1
138116	i ended up trying the patch after having too many bad experiences with the pill form. i have fibroids and am extremely irregular (skip months at a time, so i really needed to be on something. the first few months were a bit rough, but it evened out pretty smoothly after that. i've now been on the patch for over two years and i absolutely love it. i've never had it fall off, and i no longer have any side effects. in fact, 99% of the time i forget it's even there. not pregnant yet either, so it works there too. great option if you can't handle the pill.	1
13117	i am glad to see that so many people had a positive experience with xolair on this review page, i hope these reviews are real. i was fine on xolair for about a year, although i will say i did not notice too much difference. in fairness, my asthma was relatively under control at the time with a daily steroid (symbicort). one day after a shot, i experienced what can only be described as the most ridiculous sounding symptom on the xolair box, feelings of impending doom. this was 3 years ago and i have suffered from severe anxiety ever since. my life, including my marriage, has been drastically affected by xolair. please use caution before taking this and more importantly before letting your children take it.	0
175443	after just 2 doses of planned 10 day 2x/day 875mg treatment got violently ill, literally projectile vomited on brand new carpet as i couldn't get the 10 feet to toilet fast enough. stopped medicine immediately but still had massive, continuous diarrhea for almost 3 weeks, lost 17 lbs in 14 days! it was so bad/went on so long the dr actually tested me for cdiff, which was negative. will never, ever take this again!	0
231484	i have used this medication for about 8 years and without it i don't sleep. i wake every night without fail and it takes me hours to get back to sleep. this medication can be taken before bed or in the middle of the night as it's out of your system in about 4 hours. i become very relaxed in about 15 minutes upon taking it and able to rest peacefully.	1
87064	started taking 20 mg. makes me sleepy (like almost knocks me out) and had a headache for a few days. week 2 day 2 of upping dose to 40 mg now sleepy &amp; nauseous.	1
16990	taking pain killers for shingles i was constantly bloated and in pain with constipation. in fact my stools where impacted. i tried several laxatives to no avail. then i remembered as a child mum giving us milk of magnesia. so got a bottle from chemist. i did as the instructions said 1 5mils. it worked a treat.	1
170924	seroquel changed my life. after roughly 20 years of treatment with medications for borderline personality disorder i had a new doctor put me on seroquel. at first i resented the sedation, but after time i adjusted to it and the dosage was moderated and timed differently. ultimately, however, it was the first medicicne to thoroughly handle my anxiety, and stop my obsessive thoughts in their tracks. the only downside has been the carbohydrate cravings and weight gain, but even those have become manageable with other supplements and medications. the gains far out weigh losses.	1
100531	i have taken it for about a year and i no longer have cramps, i have lost weight, and my pimples have vanished. my friend however took it and got light headed. this is not for everyone but it works for me and i am not pregnant.	1
161084	my youngest son has taken it for meltdowns for some time now. he sleeps better too. it has caused him to gain some weight. my oldest son was on adhd medication for years, when he reached puberty it caused many problems. so the doctor prescribed risperidone for him too, and it has helped him gain so much self control. they are both in high school and doing well.	1
154693	i had my annual pap and they found that i had bv (i had no symptoms) so they prescribed me 4 pills (500 mg) to take of metronidazole all at one time. i took the pills on a full stomach and with water. i laied down for a nap, 2 hrs later i woke up with a 101 fever, sore throat. later that day i had the sweats and chills, colored vaginal discharge which i didn't have before, and when i ate and drank everything had a weird metal taste to it. i work night shift and never have a problem staying awake, but tonight i could barely keep my eyes open. i just feel out of it all the time. i haven't talked to my doctor yet about my side effects to this drug, but i'm thinking i should start a woman's probiotic.	0
72104	i've been on tramidol for 5 years and i have 3 crushed vertebra' s and it works great when i comes to relaxing me enough to get out and do things i normally can't do without them....	1
138539	the first 3 weeks of this medication i lost 17lbs, with little to no side effects. however, at exactly the 3 week mark i began having nothing but watery bowel movements accompanied by gas like cramps. this has gone on for 4 weeks almost everyday. i have now lost a total of 30lbs. so yes, it curbs hunger, charges your metabolism, but you can't leave the house to show off your weight loss or be active because you are stuck in the bathroom for hours at a time. i am now quitting adipex so that it does not cause long term problems. it's a great kick start for a lifestyle change but the side effects are not worth it to me.	1
76702	i was super excited to begin this drug in order to help me lose some weight. after one dose, i had a horrible headache and a jolt that went through my brain so violent, it woke me from my sleep. it scared the living &quot;l&quot; out of me. thanks, but no thanks.	0
94162	i only took this for a few days and had a terrible reaction. i lost control of my emotions. i would start crying hysterically uncontrollably for no reason then immediately flip to laughing hysterically. it was awful. i was crying and laughing so hard i had to lay down. i've taken a lot of antidepressants over the years and never had anything like this happen. it was a horrible feeling and didn't help my depression either.	0
71794	i tried tramadol at the suggestion of my dr as i don't like how lortab etc makes me feel. it didn't seem to help though. then i read somewhere to take it with an extra strength tylenol. it's like a miracle. the two together worked so well for me. it was suggested that the combination of the two enhanced the effectiveness. it did for me.	1
153604	this medicine is really working for me. i'm into my second month on it. i take 100mg twice a day, always with food. i'm starting to really notice my results at this point. i feel you need to give this medicine time to work, you can't expect results right away, my acne did get a little bit worse when i first started it but now i'm not getting any pimples and it's even helping the scars from prior acne. i also apply clindamycin at night before bed. my skin used to get really dry and flaky but now it is fine. i was nervous to take this drug at first after reading a lot of bad reviews, but i'm so glad that i tried it, i think it's great.	1
144665	i started the inplanon in 2013 when my son turned one. i gained weight and had terrible break outs. that definitely not the worst. from the moment i got it until about three weeks after removal i had no period. so up until about six months ago i had irregular periods. they came two to three times a month. on top of constant yeast infections and discharge. i was checked for any std's to be on the safe side. considering i have been with one person for nearly two years i knew it would come out negative. it was just my hormones going crazy. now i am almost two years off of it and still not ovulating or having regular periods. my significant other and i have been trying to conceive for a year now and it's caused us problems.	0
5971	before this i was on the lo lo estrine (which i'm back on). this pill was way to strong for me it would cause me to miss a period every other month. also the side effects were so bad. i was super emotional the entire month i would be taking it. i also had so much anxiety and i would even wake up anxious frenquently. that never happened so often before. the bleeding was irregular. i also was bloated all the time. i definitely wouldn't recommend this pill.	0
105674	i have had horrible tendinitis in both elbows for a year now. went to the dr. she prescribed 4mg methylprednisolone. after 2 days of taking medication, absolutely no side effects and almost no pain in my elbows!! absolutely wonderful meds!!	1
167785	i got the mirena inserted in september of 2015 is already the end of the year one more day and i'll be 2016 and i'm still bleeding... is this ever going to end!!!!!!!!! i'm just so annoyed by now when is this going to end.	0
163210	had an irregular heartbeat a month ago. not a rapid heartbeat but several normal beats follwed every 30 seconds or so with several faster heartbeats. this would repeat again. dr. diagnosed me with a-fib. placed me on propafenone 150 mg 3x a day. have not had another episode but the medicine makes me very sleepy in the afternoon. hopefully my body will adapt and this will go away. has anyone else had the same side effect? would appreciate a reply.	1
27493	taking requip from the very beginning caused drowsiness, which after 3 years has developed into sleep attacks and edema in my feet. also, an allergic reaction with a rash over most of my body.	0
224637	synthroid has changed my life -- from 16 hours/day in bed to being an active medical school student. the only side effect i have experienced is dry eye in the mornings, but that is fine with the use of artificial tears. i used synthroid for my hashimoto's and now continue to use it post-thyroidectomy. i only use the synthroid name brand because generics could be made at different labs and will not be exactly the same every month. talk to your doctor about using generics. my doctors only prescribe the name brand for me because it is important to have constant thyroid hormone levels.	1
72993	i was on minastrin 24 fe for nearly 5 months. during this time period i had horrible mood swings and i was constantly emotional. my boyfriend said that i didn't seem like myself. i also ended up gaining nearly 10 pounds and had very tender breasts all the time. i also would get awful cramps, backaches, and headaches during my periods. my periods were very light though! all in all, minastrin 24 fe was not for me. i have now switched to loestrin and i already feel so much better.	0
22358	i like the small tubes, easy to carry around if i am out of town, to stop the sticky, you have to rub it in until it's dry. i can't smell anything either, must be me, it works so well i only use it every other day. testim also gives you a year of free co-pays! now if they could only add a drug into it to keep my 21 yr old girlfriends mouth shut for a while my life would be perfect.	1
169417	i have been taking a 50mg dose twice a day for 2 weeks and have lost about 13 lbs. i struggle with remembering to take the medicine in the mornings and those are the days i tend to eat more, usually fast food. but when i do remember to take them i eat so much less and have less cravings. they make me thirsty so i drink more water, no complaints though. and i have quit bedtime snacking on unhealthy foods or portions.and my energy and mood levels are way up, making things like waking up and the morning, going to work, or just working out more enjoyable and less draining. my goal is to lose 60 pounds and with this medicine i know i can make it there.	1
176929	after my first and only shot, ten days after i broke out in a rash from head to toe. the interesting thing was the area i had given my shot was red and made a rather large circle surrounding the area where i inserted the needle. contacted my doctor and she prescribed steroids to counteract the rash. later in the evening i was in the most excruciating pain in my legs this lasted all night into the early morning. even contemplated going to the er. in the ten days being of humira i had no relief from pa. i have some plaque psoriasis and i will say that cleared up in the ten days that i was on it, only to return shortly thereafter. on a side note i would like to say humira has a wonderful support staff should you have any questions.	0
135793	i was prescribed percocet 5/325 for a displaced distal radius fracture. it was great at helping to manage the pain until i could have surgery to implant hardware to keep the fracture in place and dealt with post op pain well too. vicodin was the md's original choice but leaves me wired and sleepless. i've only used this for 4 weeks and am now down to just one tab at night. the primary side effects i've noticed now are some pretty extreme gi distress but have been told this is normal. all in all, this has been a very painful injury and i'm not sure just what i would have done without consistent pain relief. i do suggest using no more than necessary.	1
223052	i have been off and on topamax for about 5 years now and i must say that it works better for bipolar mood stabilization than any other one out there. the one thing i love the most about this medicine is that it is helping me lose weight. they need to put in the time to verify that this drug is in fact a mood stabilizer because it certainly does help with bipolar disorder.	1
170254	i've been taking this for a few weeks and i think i've already gained 10 pounds because i am hungry 100% of the time. i've had insomnia for all 20 years of my life and have yet to find a medication that makes me sleep till this one, and on the 50 mg dose. that would be amazing if it did not make me sleep for the rest of the day too. it shuts me down to the point where it is harder than normal to breathe. i've been staying with it in hopes that i would improve but all i've noticed is that i am more irritated by even the smallest things.	0
9469	my doctor prescribed me lo loestrin when i was 15 to treat my heavy, irregular periods and cramps that would cause me to stay home from school/other obligations for days at a time. it worked perfectly for me for the 5+ years that i used it! my periods lightened and became extremely regular, and it worked as pregnancy prevention later as well. i didn't experience any abnormal weight gain, and it didn't affect my acne whatsoever (neither lightened it nor made it heavier). i would definitely recommend llf!	1
7768	i was prescribed xanax by my psychiatrist because of severe anxiety. i was started on 1 mg to be taken at night. it has been the best medication prescribed for my condition as it also helped slow down the suicidal thoughts which were on a daily basis. i am still taking xanax under gp supervision, as it helps relieve the level of anxiety tremendously. it is the best medication ever made for people who are born prone to anxiety throughout their childhood/adolescence and extreme shyness, yes shyness. i also take it in conjunction with antidepressant, aropax, which helped with my depression but also with my unfortunate disability of extreme shyness which was a constant problem for me as an adult basically all my life.	1
99658	this stuff has 17 grams of sodium sulfate. grab a periodic table and do the math. the extreme sodium levels in this stuff skyrocketed my bp and could have killed me. it went to 230/132. do a search and you will find others who experienced this. no warning about elevated bp anywhere in the side-effects. really? no sodium content listed. a bag of chips requires that, but not potentially lethal drugs? something very wrong there.	0
3470	prescribed this medication for urinary tract infection since i had c-diff last year and cannot take the stronger antibiotics right now. could tell difference in bladder pressure and pain within two days however dealing with the side effect of headache, being sleepy and muscle aches makes me ready to get this all taken.	1
101605	i was prescribed robaxin 750mg x 3 daily for muscle spasms via my pain management dr tho i wasn't aware i was having muscle spasm in my lower back. i had failed laminectomy l4/l5 with several back injections post to help with the pain. nothing has worked. was on nucyntaer and oxy 7.5/325 3x daily -this worked beautifully. dr changed oxy to 5mg &amp; replaced robaxin 750 x3. i only taken 3 and i have suffered multiple charlie horses in my legs and toes; my leg remains stiff and i am terrified more spasm activity. already my quality of life has changed for the worse. i am afraid to continue this drug. this is the only thing that has changed and i never had spasms before! why would i take more?	0
34945	i have been suffering from migraines for about 2 years now. i've tried a few different prescription pills and i've suffered from horrible side effects from each one. i was to the point where i felt almost hopeless because i couldn't do anything to relieve the pain when i would get migraines. my neurologist prescribed me migrainal last month and i've had 3 horrible migraines since then. each time i have used migrainal within 30 minutes they are gone and i feel great and not defeated by the horrible migraine. i definitely would recommend and consider this a miracle!	1
198599	i had my 1 &amp; only shot in march 2017 and immediately felt bloated and sick so i decided not to get another one. i had my first period in may 2017 and have bled on and off every few days since. i have currently been bleeding for 17 days straight and i haven't had longer than a 5 day break in between bleeds the entire time. i'm bloated, hormonal and very tired. i hate not knowing my body or its cycle and am at a loss of what to do. i do not recommend this shot to anyone!	0
218333	cleared up my symptoms within a couple of days. felt much better after day 8. no side effects, as i also take acidophilus.	1
15847	i have been on this for almost two years now. remind you i'm 18 now but i hate this birth control! everyone's body is different but has anyone else had abdominal pain?!!! my boyfriend and i can barely get through sex because i have such bad pain! it's not even cramping which is what scares me. what also scares me is that my period are completely gone. gone! it may seem like a pro for some but when i miss 3 months and only get my period for 2 days and it's light and looks as if i am spotting... that worries me. i even took a pregnancy test. multiple actually just to check. i would not recommend. i haven't had problems with skin or weight gain. actually i have lost weight. but the abdominal pain and cramping. not worth it.	0
194483	no doubt lipitor at any dose does lowers your numbers. but what does that really mean, has plaque in your arteries reduced by same percentage ? i think not. still statins might have their place but who can tolerate them, very few if you research. i just wish the doctors would push and insist on diet/exercise plans before prescribing statins. was on liptor only 10 mg for 18 months, numbers down but felt like crap. the usual intense body muscle aches. off for a week now and my body is telling me already it needs a break from statin drugs. i'm totally satisfied to move forward and roll dice with diet/exercise. doctor is in full agreement to drop statin for now. 66 year old male and still very active despite some heart failure.	1
68214	this product is a life saver! i had sex with my boyfriend 3 days after my previous cycle ended and the condom broke. obviously, very upset and scared i went out to my local shops and purchased plan b for about $50. i took both pills within 4 hours of the incident. for about 4 days after the fact, i was experiencing cramping, extreme nausea, and was being very moody and constantly fighting with everyone around me. about a week and a half later i began spotting. it was dark red, very light and definitely not my period. this lasted for about 4 days. i didn't get my period on the expected time but i felt all the symptoms as usual. however my period came on the 44 day of my cycle. almost 2 weeks late! this pill works.	1
118580	today is my 5th day of taking the medication. i too was worried about taking it after reading some horror stories regarding the side effects. i am happy to say that so far the only side effects that i've experienced is a little tiredness the first day and the bad taste in my mouth which i've noticed that i've experience more in the middle of the night upon waking for various reasons. all in all i am pleased, other then the fact that i have to take them for 14 days. good luck to all!	1
40604	i found this to be a wonderful muscle relaxant with very few, if any, negative side effects. it worked well for me during many bouts of chronic back pain that kept me awake at night. it did make me a little bit sleepy and dizzy, but nothing that bothered me very much at all. at night, this wasn't even a concern, but i could easily take it during the day at work and perform and feel fine. this isn't exactly a &quot;pain&quot; medication but i did find that it worked almost as well for my particular back pain as the narcotic medicines i was also prescribed.	1
148410	had mirena inserted march 2016 and had a horrible month of cramps and bleeding. things subsided for a couple of months but now i have heavy bleeding 2-3 weeks a month. even though it is just coming up on 6 months i emotionally don't know how much longer i can take this and it is wrecking my intimacy with my fianc&eacute;. my periods much worse and much less predictable than before :(	0
34211	i have been on so many muscle relaxers and pain control medications while waiting for hip replacements that it was unbelievable. about four years ago my doctors (air force type) put me on a steady regimen of tramadol 50mg tabs up to 300mg per day dependent on pain and i have been able to completely manage my pain and even walk in short bursts (sometimes with a cane but that's still walking in my condition) it is an amazing revelation.	1
72301	tramadol is a good medication that can take care of a wide range of pain. this medication is a great sub to addictive meds. a medication that only manages the pain and does not manage your mental state.	1
98629	i've had this for 5 weeks and my period is still on. i'm just fed up i'm not moody but i'm always hungry. plus it made my face break out i never get break outs. i will see in a couple more weeks if my period is supposed to stop, i read somewhere it takes about 3 months but honestly think i want to be buying pads that long.	0
209018	im 36yr old woman who has polymyostsis it been a struggle for the last 7 years ups and downs. i have relapsed very often. the acthar treatment seems to work i guess once it gets to your system. side effects are kind of unbearable. i live everyday grateful but hoping it will go into remission. but from what my doctor says the acthar treatment help get my cpk levels under control.	0
214224	omg my vagina is on fire!!!!! i just put the 1-day maximum strength treatment miconazole. i am really regretting putting it on. i can't sleep it burns so bad. i was reading some of the review and people seem to suggest that the cream is what makes it worse but idk. i just went to the bathroom to wipe it off with the cooling wipes and that stuff burns so bad. i just finished putting a&amp;d ointment, i really hope that helps. but as of right now, i am dying!!!!!!	0
47738	i've been using this product for 5 weeks now. before this, i have mild acne on the forehead and cheeks. i went to dermatologist and the specialist prescribed me this product to apply on my entire face every night for 2 months. and after 1 week using this adapalene cream, my acne gets worse and worse. pimples keep popping out everywhere on my face even on areas that have never had pimples before. i am still using it because it does says on the brochure that the product's effect may be seen after 8 weeks. i'm using aiken tea tree oil for my pimples so that they will 'shrink' and heal quickly. so for the time being, i'm just gonna bear with all the acne on my face and wait for miracles of differin adapalene cream to work.	0
180892	i was prescribed biaxin for bronchitis. i've taken three pills. i have an horrible taste in my mouth all the time along with severe dry mouth. my stomach is tossing and turning, making the loudest noises i've ever heard a stomach make! i haven't had problems with nausea/vomiting but the diarrhea from this is horrendous! on the second day of taking this i got this huge burst of energy and wanted to clean every inch of my house and rearrange each room! (sort of strange as i'm still coughing constantly and having a very hard time breathing) i'm also having trouble sleeping. i'm not sure that i will be taking anymore of these.	0
79819	this medication has been a god send. before i knew about this medication i was in and out of the bathroom at least 7 times in one day and it was every time i put food in my mouth. that went on for a full year, i couldn't go anywhere without going to the bathroom first and if i was out and about i couldn't eat anything until i got home. me and my wife couldn't even go out to eat on our anniversary because of my problem. it was taking over my life and i was getting depressed, but then my doctor gave me lomotil and it works like a charm. instead of going to the bathroom after each time i put food in my mouth. i now only go about 2 times a day and i can now eat at restaurants now. ihis medication put reassurance back in my life again.	1
194380	worst medication ever!! allergic reactions and cramps in leg from losartan mar, 2015, ended up on crutches, doc misdiagnosed fell on crutch broke rt wrist, metal plate in it now.surgery on wrist, mri showed complete torn ligament in rt ankle, surgery on ankle, dilauded 4 months, doc put me on crestor/bp meds, had a stroke, wheelchair bound,ran out of crestor/6 weeks, finally walking with cane, doc put me back on crestor. allergic reaction to crestor after 2 months, rapid heart, dizzy, leg swelling,pains in chest,massive leg cramps, now left foot is barely usable, another ligament torn possibly,then mini stroke, dr stopped crestor, now i have iron deficiency issues. been off crestor since june but all these side effects are still haunting.	0
52593	1 year ago my md put me on synthroid and after 3 months i had so much pain in my legs, i stopped taking it and my pain went away. i discovered armour thyroid and it made such a difference in the way i felt.	1
7346	save yourself some money, visit a doctor &amp;... do not buy this off the shelf treatment! worst experience in my life. i used to treat a yeast infection, not only did it not solve my symptoms it gave me excruciating pain and burning sensation every time i applied it. had to discontinue on day 3 because the discomfort was unbearable... the yeast infection went away with the second day of my period. this product should never be for sale!	0
26654	i started taking sprintec at 15, and have been taking it for a little over a year now, because my dermatologist recommended it, and said it would help regulate my period and stop cramps. and it did just that! i have not had sex yet, so i have no personal experience for pregnancy prevention, however i hear it works very well. i had no side effects except a little weight gain in my breasts - i went from a 34 b to a 36 c. but every birth control has different effects on different girls. don't be afraid to give this one a try.	1
198922	okay so i heard so much bad things about this shot, but for me oh my gosh it's just amazing. i used to take birth control everyday because i had in regular periods and that would cause me ovary cystitis and yeah the birth control did get rid of that and regulate my period but oh my gosh, i gained so much weight and i was so mean and emotional that it was ridiculous. i try about 3 different and i stopped because it was making my life horrible and then i tried the drop shot, i have not gained any weight(actually lost, just eating right and usual exercise), my acne has cleared up a lot, i'm not moody at all(it's amazing) and you just do it every 3 months. i feel like if your a type of person that the daily birth control don't work, try this	1
91635	the first couple nights, i experienced horrible nightmares in which i could not awake from until 2 1/2 hours later when my alarm finally sounded. the next week, my dosage was increased which i experienced severe weakness, dizziness and vomiting. the third week, my dosage was again increased and i experienced the inability to go to sleep. these side effects caused me to discontinue the medication.	0
144933	this is the worst thing that ever happened to me i decided to get it as i heard it helps with cramps it sure did but its been a year and one month and ive had my period non-stop for the whole time my self-esteem is down, i feel unattractive and disgusting i am getting rid of this thing as soon as possible im typing this out with tears in my eyes. this is the worst thing that i have ever used.	0
32724	my son has been taking symbicort 200/6 for 4 years and it has worked well. he started feeling fatigued about a year ago and has been diagnosed in the last week with adrenal suppression/shutdown which is a noted possible reaction. if any users feel fatigued or have difficulty fighting infections i would suggest getting cortisol tested promptly.	0
175497	this patch is worlds above and beyond anything otc. it's awesome and works wonderfully.	1
128798	i started the medicine november 5th 2014. i was working 10 hour days i broke my foot few days later unable to walk, work or anything. 30 days later i was 19lbs lighter. i'm still on limited movement but i am happy with the results. i started our at 246lbs my goal is 150lbs.	1
216682	i was on advair for about five years and was able to breathe easily almost immediately after starting it. before advair, i used albuterol 6-10 times daily. i used to take the 500/50 advair only once per day. using it twice a day didn't make a difference in breathing, so that saved some money. i never had a thrush problem; actually, i never rinsed out my mouth at all. the reason i'm not using it any longer is the huge cost. my insurance is no longer covering it and i cannot afford over $300 for just one diskus. am now taking singular and am back using the albuterol rescue inhaler 6-7 times a day.	1
91111	i had a botox treatment to my bladder for oab on december 21, 2016. my urologist did not counsel me on the side effects or send me home after the treatment with an antibiotic as directed in the botox pamphlet. since that time, i have had two uti's and still cannot empty my bladder. it is march 7 and i still have to self-cath every four hours. like someone else wrote, i'm afraid my bladder will never be the same again and right now it feels like i'll be self-cathing for months. i wish i had never heard of botox for my bladder!	0
66535	i had c-diff and vancomycin worked great. i had been sick for over 4 months.	1
100168	after 5 years of not being on birth control i was prescribed apri (.15mg/0.03mg). i was on it for a month and just felt very angry all the time. i constantly lashed out at my loved ones. the week before i was on the non active pill (white ones) i had cramps 5 days straight , when originally when i was off birth control i hardly had cramps. i saw no difference in my acne. but i just couldn't handle being so angry and snapping at everyone around me. i switched to tri sprintec and have been on that for a month and i am back to my usual self (hope this works instead). so if you experience bad side effects or just aren't yourself , switch to something else.	0
203318	this was my first ever birth control experience and although it worked fairly well for the first month concerning period regulation, i had major breakthrough bleeding on my second pack that resembled a heavy, two-week long period on my active pills. my endocrinologist hadn't asked me about history with mental illness before she prescribed me this medication and unfortunately the pill magnified my severe depression progressively throughout my three packs. because of it, i am more emotionally fragile and cry very easily. my anxiety has been heightened to a point where i can't go outside at the risk of panicking, and i'm constantly very jittery/shaky. i would not recommend this product for women experiencing any sort of depression or anxiety.	0
198967	most horrible two months of my life, i've been bleeding nonstop and extremely moody. my whole life has been hell and i'm never getting this thing again.	0
174515	i get cold sores when i go in excessive sun at least once a year. i could see that the sore was coming this time around, so i grabbed some abreva. not only did it seem to be of little affect, but it made my blister grow more than i have seen it without treating it with anything. the abreva takes the pain away, but as for the blistering, it only makes it larger.	0
20292	doesn't taste too bad for having to drink it. it is effective. doesn't seem to have to have any negative effects on me. and works quickly especially compared to other pain meds.	1
148801	hi, i am on this site looking for information for my niece who is has had an iud for a couple of years. after reading so many women comment that they tried the iud because of heavy bleeding, i wanted to share my experience. i had very heavy bleeding and painful periods my whole life. in my forties i discovered a supplement called cool cayenne. it is a cayenne pepper capsule sold at health food stores. it helped my periods become lighter and cramping ceased. when i felt my period coming on i started to take one or two capsules and this helped greatly. if you are on an iud strictly for a heavy period ( and do not need one for birth control), then you should research cayenne and heavy periods/cramps. the brand i took is solaray.	0
27342	the first time i took this i got a severe panic attack. it felt like i couldn't breathe, my heart was racing and chest hurt. it did nothing for the pain or any of the other things associated with migraines. i did try it once more, as per my dr, and it happened all over again. maxalt is what i use now.	0
31842	i thought something was wrong with me to. i got the seven day treatment. the burning and itching is ridiculous. i freaking took a plastic butter knife and went to work. felt so good to relieve the itch with that. i'm sorry but i won't be continuing this mess. a good three days is enough for me. i rather use a home remedy than go through this again.	0
15938	like most of you probably are doing, i took it upon myself to look up some reviews as to how women felt/responded/liked/disliked lolo. stop right there. i read nightmarish reviews after i took my first pill and was paranoid i'd experience some of the &quot;symptoms&quot; and &quot;side effects&quot; others did. the day after my first pill i felt sleepy and my body felt weak; aside from that, nothing. my transition was seamless. granted everyone's different, but after feeling no difference i began to think maybe the things said here were all in their heads? i have absolutely no complaints about lolo. my sex drive hasn't been affected in the slightest, i'm very, very big on taking care of my face and skin and i haven't had any acne, pimples, etc... go for it!!!!	1
225897	i was like one of those fluorescent bulbs flickering out..had adhd and depression. when i was upped to the 300mg in week two the bulb was changed, light was on. forget the light, i was solar powered. sexual side effects nymphomaniac 1st 2 weeks. healthy by week 3. husband couldn't keep up. i woke up without an alarm went to bed slept great. i started working out. then i got a rash. i was devastated. i wanted to explore the possibility of continuing while living on allergy medicines. i tried that for a few day but the good feelings were gone. my body refused to cooperate with my mind and emotions. drug companies please come up with another antidepressant ndri i can take. goodbye wellbutrin, with you the honeymoon was grand. going to try out cymbalta.	1
167701	i've had my mirena placed back in january of 2011 after i had my son. my insertion wasn't bad, but it wasn't terrible either. i didn't have any ill side effects like so many experiences on here. i had normal cycles up until 2013 when my cycle stopped. the only thing i didn't like was it was uncomfortable intimately. it literally left me bent over after intercourse with spotting. i'm scheduled to have mine removed jan 20 2016. it's been a great form of bc for me outside of intercourse. i'm not planning on getting another one placed unless i decide i've had enough of the shot.	1
64032	was on lexapro 20mg one a day for year thought i would try something different dr said try zoloft 50 mg a day omg what a mistake. first week bad dreams, rash, itchy, dizziness no sex drive etc. terrible not for me going back on lexapro.	0
71045	entering the 7th hour of the process during my 1st infusion; i experienced annoying itching deep within my ears, back of throat, head and face. shortly after the &quot;push&quot;, increasing the drip, i broke out into hives on my face, head and neck with red welts ironically appearing in the areas where i had historically given myself the enbrel injections...front of both thighs and stomach. enbrel had stopped its effectiveness after almost 2 yrs and it had been almost 1 month from my last injection prior to the infusion. my dr made the decision to discontinue the infusion fearing that my allergic reaction may cause anaphylaxis.	0
208742	gives good relief but gives stomach pains side effect and paranoia side effect if taken more than 3 days	0
141988	my psychologist originally suggested lexapro to treat my anxiety and panic disorder, then my doctor prescribed it. i was told that it is not habit forming and that it has low side effects and works well to treat panic disorder. i started out on 10mg for 3 weeks then went up to 20mg. my side effects have been mild and have included nausea (the first few days), weight loss (which i don't mind) because of decreased appetite, mild increased sweating, and recently trouble falling asleep. all in all i am very pleased with it and have had only one panic attack in over a month. i used to have multiple ones weekly. i feel like i am finally getting my life back and i would recommend this medicine to anyone.	1
89168	this medicine seemed to be helping with my anxiety somewhat, but i had to stop taking it because it was making me extremely forgetful! i would forget simple things, like my daughter had to go to school, what i had for lunch, just things you shouldn't forget. i felt in a fog..was very strange. i'm currently looking for another medication to help with my anxiety and depression, so far no luck :(	0
144464	i absolutely hate it! i've had it for less than a week and my acne is awful! my face is greasy and my hair is falling out. also, by mood swings are terrible. do not waste your time and money.	0
117299	diagnosed with atrial fibrillation a little over two years ago. started ryhthmol after taking thinners in preparation for cardioreversion. heart went back to normal rhythm just before i was to be shocked. had infrequent short periods of atrial fibrillation reoccuring. doctor prescribed another anti-arrhythmics but i felt as though tennis ball was bouncing inside my chest. went back to rythmol 325 sr and atenolol, both twice a day. i have stayed in rhythm for about a year, i have found that coffe and some iced teas cause me to go out.	1
35775	i was a herion addict for 10yrs and at my rock bottom lost everything, sold everything even my beloved dog just for a bag, sick isnt the word for herion addiction, i had know way out. one got caught stealing cell phones from my family members, i was in jail detoxing thinking i was going to die. once i got out jail clean i was determined to find a suboxone doctor and i did it was the best choice i have ever made! now im 2 years clean and suboxone was a important tool and helping me do so! i owe my life to suboxone and it really offends me when people bash the drug because its a true life saving drug!	1
1401	sumatripan injections probably saved my life. the only thing that works on my cluster headaches. the injections are expensive, but my doctor backed me up in my battle with my insurance company. works in 15 minutes or less, major side effect that i have found is burning but, i'll take that rather than the headache.	1
120738	-not a very good one. complained to drs . about dry mouth,diarrhea, and numbness in toes. tingling at tip of fingers. they dismissed it as nothing. the numbness has progressed to my foot,legs,hands,arms. have trouble walking without a cane because i loose my balance and have fallen many times.	0
208964	i too suffer from insomnia. i've been on ambien since i gave birth to my son. every few months i have to stop taking it because it loses its effect on me. in february, i was one of the first persons to try belsomra. 10mg was my dosage. it didn't work at all. my doctor told me to double up. i like that it focused of a different part of the brain. when it did work, after 2 pills, it was fine. maybe i should try a new dose. i'm back on ambien until it wears off.	0
207154	i used toviaz for 10 days and its side effects started to be unbearable. so i had to give it up.. maybe if i would continue to use, it could show its true effects but dry mouth and dizziness made me very bad..	0
214782	i have been taking prevpac for a week now, and the horrible abdominal pain is long gone. :) however, i am experiencing rather unpleasant back pain as a side effect. i have been stretching like crazy trying to mitigate it, but it doesn't seem to be working. i am using ice packs and a portable tens unit to deal with it. while not fun, it is a whole lot better than the agony of an h. pylori infection.	1
145489	update: 7.5 kicked in, cravings gone, back to being full right away, and forgetting to eat..should keep a food diary. now down to 163. i took the 2 week trial and it worked great, no side effects, and i felt great, i went from 185-180 in the 2 weeks, i felt full right away, dehydrated so i was drinking ton's of water, craved no sweets, small portions filled me up fast, now i'm on the 7.5 dosage and i feel hungry all the time, don't feel as dehydrated and the cravings are starting to creep back up. i hope it's a minor set back and it will go away once my system get's used to the higher dosage; insurance didn't cover this so i just shelled out $145.00 for 30 days worth of pills so i hope they work	1
226994	implanon is amazing. i've been struggling for over five years with hormonal birth control pills. they caused me to gain weight, go in and out of depression, have horrible mood swings, acne, everything that could go wrong did. i was so sick of trying different pills (yaz, progestin, microgestin fe 1/20..) i wanted something non hormonal. i've had implanon for nearly 4 months now and the only side effect is that i'll have random periods sometimes, but that might be my body trying to adjust. otherwise, no mood swings, i've lost 16 pounds, no horrible periods, nothing.	1
181573	it was very disappointing when zoloft and ability didn't work for me, but prozac began working within 4 to 5 days of taking. this medicine is working good for my ocd.	1
143985	i got nexplanon 12/2015 right after giving birth. i bleed lightly six to seven months after insertion. i haven't had a period since. bloating, but no spotting. nothing. i have had the mood swings but to me, that is expected when hormones are altered especially after pregnancy. i've gained weight 20 freaking pounds. (could have been to postpartum depression too) ugh! other than that i think it is very effective.	1
23259	without methadone, i wouldn't be here typing this. it literally saved my life. i was a heavy narcotic user for over 10 years, my withdrawal nearly killed me from dehydration. i got admitted to a methadone program after being discharged from the hospital. ever since, my life changed around, for the best. i don't have to worry about getting sick anymore, thanks to methadone. i've tried both versions, liquid and pills, pills are much better.	1
92874	i have been battling major depression and anxiey for years and was at the point of saying this illness is meant to be my fatality. after several tries on different antidepressants. trintellix has given me a new outlook on life. if you are at the point of tiresome trial and error do not give up until you try trintellix. the benefits out way the side effects.	1
96960	ambien definitely puts me to sleep quickly and keeps me asleep. however, it has made me do crazy things without remembering the next morning. i have taken more than the recommended dose while sleep walking, cut 3 inches off my hair, drove my car, many different things. i would love this medicine if i just didn't act crazy because it really does work.	0
77340	on day 6, i noticed a little more room in my belt and decided to weigh a day early - 194.5lbs down to 187lbs. i've lost 55 pounds from my tubbiest in 2003 (about 20 of that was water weight when i got my pacemaker replaced) but hit a plateau around 195lbs for the last 6 months. my goal is 170lbs by year end. my trepidation about being a guinea pig for a new medicine is more than balanced by the ease and amount of the result. i'm expecting further improvement in backache and joint pain as my weight continues to drop. now on day 14 at 184 pounds, i've lost 10 pounds, twice my stretch goal, and feel great. this is too easy!	1
5294	i started this birth control completely fine the first week. after the first week i started bleeding bad and continued to take the pill. i had been bleeding for 3 months straight while on cryselle	0

61669	i started taking this after resisting medication for acute depression. i'm going through a life changing situation that won't last forever so i am hoping my time on this med will be limited to just a year. this is day 3 of 10mg. my only complaint is that i seem to have to poo constantly (not diarrhea). i'm worried about the libido issue and not enough time has passed for me to know if it'll become a problem. i seem to take longer to fall asleep and feel that i'm sleeping much lighter than before. every little sound or movement from my husband wakes me. other than that it's been positive. yesterday i was actually a little bit giddy. i haven't been like that in over a year. it felt nice.	1
42319	please note this medication (atenolol) did in fact make me lose hair. each morning, i awake to comb my hair. i noticed large amount of hair left in my comb. i start searching the web on my medications. there it was atenolol. (hair loss) i told my doctor and was put on another beta blocker. the hair lose stopped.	0
197927	hard to know if it works,i've been on it for two years following surgery,aortic valve replacement,vsd repair,maze procedure..two month ago i had an afib episode. when my heart feel off,this medicine helps control the symptoms but overall with the combination of losartan and warfarin, i feel,tired,depressed,i'm sun sensitive,get unexplained rashes,have a low sex drive,diarrea...considering it didn't help relapsing al i want to do is stop using it.	0
13242	meh. i was on vyvanse, 70 mg/day &amp; switched to mydayis 25 mg/day. not what i was hoping for. not by a long shot. while it &quot;lasts longer&quot; than vyvanse (was on vyvanse for years) which only gave me about 5/6 hours in the end, it gives me much less motivation. makes me depressed. i'm very sorry i did not only get only a 2 week supply rather than 1 month. i have no insurance &amp; it was about $100 more than vyvanse. needless to say, i will request vyvanse again at my next appt. big disappointment.	0
55488	amazing diet pill. i don't usually give reviews but i had to share my experience. i have been overweight for a very very long time. i've tried numerous diets and workouts but i haven't been able to shed the extra weight. within 1 week on belviq i noticed a difference and so did my friends and co-workers. at week two i had to take my belt down a notch. this is my third week and it feels amazing.	1
164168	helps dry eye - but generates terrible long-lasting bitter taste in the mouth, that stays for 4-6 hours or even more) and makes every food or drink taste bad. i called shire and they know that this is an effect of the drug - but they have no idea what causes it or how to counter it. so - we cannot even know for sure that this is not a long-lasting damage to the taste bud or to any other important function. the longest clinical trials were for 12 months. thus any long-lasting damage is not known. the thought is troublesome and so is that bitter taste.	0
99981	took viorele for 2 months and i had to stop. started taking the pill when my period started and my period went on for 4 weeks (medium bleeding). i also got nauseous after taking the first pack. nausea and long bleedings stopped with the second pack. however, with the second pack i was very moody, i had this uncontrollable anger and being so angry made me cry so much. planning to switch to a lower dose pill. being off the pill for 2 weeks, i can feel the difference. even my boyfriend notices. i feel like i am no longer angry and moody all the time.	0
150598	i was prescribed bactrim for a very painful uti that i could not flush out naturally with water and cranberry. my uti pain subsided after about 5 hours of the first dose of bactrim which is great. however, the side effects are not so pleasant. i have had chills, mild diarrhea, vivid nightmares/dreams and extreme migraines. i am on day 3 of a 7 day prescription, but i am contemplating stopping after day 4 or 5 if the side effects continue. the side effects are still not as bad as the uti pain!	1
154687	this medicine does it's job, my symptoms from the infection cleared within the first 3 days out of 7, taking 2 pills a day. it worked and cleared the infection so i'll give it 10 stars, but the side effects are for sure mentionable. i felt fine other than a metallic taste in my mouth for the first 2 days, then the extreme nausea rolled in. imagine the feeling you have seconds before you puke, 24/7 for days on end. i also had headaches and slight stomach pain. i took probiotics while on the medication and they didn't do anything. i still recommend this antibiotic because it does its job, just be prepared for the side effects.	1
105608	took whole pak over the 5 days for sciatic nerve pain and numbness and cramps in left calf and foot. it had zero effect, i might as well ate skittles candy.	0
14066	i feel like it makes my symptoms worse. i get this cold, tingling feeling in my throat and it feels like someone's sitting on my back. i've been on it for a few years. if anything, it makes me need to use my inhaler more	0
133101	on month 5 of taking sprintec and it has almost completely cleared my cystic acne that i have had for over 5 years! now all i have to do is clear up these acne scars!	1
220410	i don't like taking medication, but my headaches were now in a state of chronic tension/migraine being triggered by anything excessive like exercising, too much cleaning, too much activity, too much light or stress. i was prescribed elavil for headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep trouble, back, neck, and arm pain. i've taken it for a week, and after one dose, the first thing i noticed was an awesome night's sleep, and no neck or jaw pain, pain on rising. i feel completely relaxed in the morning, a little drowsy but am able to function and get my three kids to school. i have been taking it at 10pm and feel tired until noon, so i think i'm going to take it earlier in the evening. i haven't noticed any side effects at all. i am taking 10 mg.	1
139049	i started taking this medicine on june 10th, 2009. it is now june 19th and i have lost 5 1/2 pounds. this is not the first time i have taken this medicine. i took it 7 years ago and lost 60 pounds in 10 months. never had a problem with it. it was the only thing that worked for me after several attempts to lose weight on other programs with no success. the main reason why i like this medication is because it curbs my appetite and i don't feel hungry as much and i don't have the cravings i used to have. i feel like i'm in control. a word of advice - i am noticing this time around, if you have any problems with pinched nerves such as pain and discomfort, this medication will increase that pain and discomfort.	1
88519	i used prepopik one day prior to my colonoscopy. first, it is expensive when not covered by insurance. if i had not had a coupon it would have cost over $100. second, it took a while to start working. lastly, when they did the colonoscopy i was not sufficiently cleaned out and the procedure had to be rescheduled. i will use other more effective methods the next time around.	0
205787	best thing ever. i have been suffering from years of depression and since taking pristiq i feel alive again. more energy, weight loss, and decreased negative thoughts add up to happiness! tried others, but none compare.	1
32374	dr put me on this garbage and in less than a monrth im back in the emeregency room. dehydrated so weak i coundnt even lay down, foul tasting food i lost 14 lbs i couldnt afford to lose, dry cough, dizzeness, i already had insomnia for the last fifteen years this garbage did nothing but make me very ill, stomach pain, vomiting, cramps.etc.....	0
137553	i used accutane about a year ago and it did wonders for my skin. as for side effects, i had dry lips but it was not a problem. i took the medication for five months and it cleared my acne. i had never felt so good about myself. after six months of taking it, my acne came back. i heard that you sometimes have to go on a second round with it before it totally clears your acne for a long time. accutane is the best and i highly recommend it to anyone who tried everything to clear their skin. it is expensive but worth it.	1
79479	i'm 17, i had protected sexual intercourse the condom ripped and that's when i decided to take plan b. i did not think that this pill would work, its my first time trying something like this but the pill actually worked for me. today i'm relieved that i got my period. thanks to plan b i don't have to worry anymore.	1
120156	hycodan worked great for the cough, but i ended up with a rebound headache the next morning. it also made me itchy and have strange dreams. even with all these side effects, it was worth it to have a good nights sleep.	1
64403	have experienced anxiety my whole life along with occasional panic attacks that come and go. i was so excited to try zoloft after reading all these positive reviews but i only ended up taking one pill and i won't be taking another! it's different for everyone, but for me, i took 25mg at 5pm and the next morning i was nauseous, was pissing out my butthole and couldn't eat for another 12 hours. i woke up again this morning still feeling very sick with diarrhea. i would rather have the stomach flu than ever experience that again. i'm going on the second day without taking it and i'm still not fully recovered from being that sick. i gave it a 3 because other than that, i felt no other side effects except a little tingly the first hour or so.	0
183707	this medication made me nauseous for 12 hours a day about 30 minutes after i took it. my doctor changed me to wellbutrin, but i am weary to try it.	0
94763	abilify is not for everyone. i experienced severe personality change within a month. the story: i have had bipolar disorder since i was 13 and have been in treatment for 9 years. when abilify came out, we tried abilify to &quot;bridge&quot; getting me off atypical antipsychotics and onto a mood stabilizer. the 20 day experience was horrible. my personality changed radically. i didn't know myself anymore. friends, my lover, my boss, all begged me to stop. i felt weird on it, not better. severe personality changes are possible with abilify. i called my psych, we stopped the medicine and moved onward. those 20 days were destructive, but my friends &amp; job were kind and life returned to normal.	0
23711	this works very well for me. i prefer soma but my doctor says its highly addictive and has too much interaction with the other medicines.	1
223551	this drug is garbage and should be taken off the market, doesn't work keeps you up all night when you have to work a 12hr shift the next day. causes rls, migraine, and insomnia	0
150467	worst medicine ever!!!!! i got this to get rid of my uti and while taking it i had the worst side effects. itching, rash, headaches. and i am off the medication finally it's been a week now and i am still getting headache's. i don't know what to do. i wish i never took it.	0
36314	my bald head, forehead, and face have the actinic keratosis spots to be treated. i tried one laser peel and it did well for about 6 months. it was painful and the recovery was as well. i tried efudex cream several times and had some success. i am on the zyclara now for 7 days with just some itching, redness and minor swelling. i made the mistake of being in the sun for 5 hours on the sixth day and had to skip the treatment one night due to some pain. some sores have began to appear like old zits. it wont be pretty for several weeks but it should be worth it to avoid cancer.	1
192125	i started yaz about a year ago. first it wasn't too bad seeing as my previous pills made my legs swell some kind of crazy. but now into a year and 20 pounds heavier i've decided to come off of them. between the weight gain, now swelling legs, being tired all the time, no sex drive, mood swings like no ones business, and random spotting, the only thing good that has came out of these pills is the fact i haven't gotten pregnant.	0
129325	it has been quite awhile since i've taken the plan b pill, but i used to take it regularly. i was in a very bad place for a couple of years and ended up taking it 9 times.. yes, 9 times. i've taken it over 24 hours after inter course and i never became pregnant. only about 4 of those times were accidents, the other 5 were stupidity. i would never recommend taking plan b ever, especially not that many times. it caused me horrible hormonal imbalances for a long time and i was in a lot of pain. statistics say that out of those times i should have become pregnant at least once, but i didn't somehow by the grace of god. it works!	1
80887	i made the mistake of taking this medicine before going to bed. i woke up in my own excrement. seriously, this no laughing matter. it was like something out of a dumb &amp; dumber movie. i had a raging case of explosive diarrhea. i feel sorry for the poor souls who don't use at least 3-ply toilet paper. food went right through me like fat people go through twinkles. i would only recommend if you take a lower dosage than the recommended one.	0
13133	i had ciu for a year and half before my first xolair shot. for six months, i never went a day without hives, experienced the lip swelling and face swelling once (never want that experience again). i was told by my allergist that i had exhausted all types of therapy so xolair was my last and only option. my first shot was in january, three days later i was hive free. i took monthly shots for 6 months, no hives so we decided to try 6 weeks between shots, no hives. it is august now - no hives! yes it is expensive but not being covered with hives from my head to my toes makes that worth it. i would agree that it has made me gain about 10 pounds and i workout just about every day. i look like i am pregnant but not ready to give up yet.	1
164242	i only used this medication twice. i understand that you usually need to use medication for an extended amount of time to get the full results of it, but i am not able to function with the effects of just two days. i can handle the bad taste. yes, it is bad, but that can be dealt with. however, after using it i immediately began to feel dizzy and lightheaded. there was a pressure in my head and i felt nauseous. every time i turned my head, i would feel very disoriented and lightheaded again. i am physically tough and can handle pain and discomfort, but there is no way i can function and work with these conditions. the more reviews i read the more i realize there seems to be way to many dangers than advantages to this medication.	0
35612	started using another product and was switched to ciclopirox about 4 months ago bc of expensive of prior medication. toe nail fungus continues to disappear. started applying other medication in jan '15, so it's been about 11 mos total of treatment. be advised: one use said they removed ciclopirox with acetone. you don't need to use acetone. instead, alcohol is specified once/week to remove the lacquer.	1
177772	i started taking cymbalta about one month ago. initially the dose was 30mg for 2 weeks and 60mg following. i cannot believe how well this has helped me. i suffered with depression and severe anxiety. i will continue this medication as i understand full benefit may not be reached for several months. overall i am extremely satisfied with cymbalta. my only side effects are constipation and decreased appetite which i have resolved with miralax and eating small meals more often. i also realized the increased taste of salt during my meals which has seemed to decrease more each day.	1
52237	i'm 39 years old height is 5 &quot;4&quot; and i have been on adipex for a month now and this medicine works. before i weighed 19lbs and now i'm down to 181lbs. i haven't started going to the gym yet. i just watch what i eat. i take half of the tablet everyday around 10:30am. yes i experience dry mouth but that helps in drinking lots of water. i had jitters the first week and that is gone now. it didn't bother me at all because i have a set goal. i just joined the gym and will be starting next week. i will update you after a week in the gym...good luck to all.	1
74653	for me it was awful. i was on this pill for 7 days. i went to the doctor today because my heart was beating so fast on these pills and i was paranoid, anxious, shaking, and very very bit**y. i thought i was having a heart attack at work i was crying, it was awful. i went to the doctor and i couldn't get words out. my pulse was 115 and blood pressure was high (never ever is) it just shot up. the doctor said i was having a panic attack and that it is due to the medication. she took me off it and for the next 5 days i am on lorazepam 0.5mg (sedative to calm me down - take it at night) and switching me back to sertaline. this was the worst experience of my life. i thought i was going to end up in the er or dead.	0
209390	i have been taking 1 tablet of nifedipin(e) xl 30 mg er for almost 2 years. i stop in the summer and start again when it gets cold and that works well for me. i haven't had any of the side effects such as rashes or headaches but i have been very tired and now that i think of it, it's probably because i've been taking it during the day instead of at night like i used to. the only problem with that is if you like to have a cocktail and for times like that i just don't take it.	1
124736	i've been on this birth control for two weeks now, and i have had so many side effects. sore breast, stomach cramps, bloating, and very bad acne. i would compare them to pregnancy symptoms. really hate feeling like i'm pregnant, and it really helped seeing that other girls have had the same experience with this.	0
75038	ever since i was a child, i have had recurring urinary tract infections that only became more frequent as i grew older. i was having 4-12 uti's a year and was treated for 8 kidney infections, three of which required hospitalization. nitrofurantoin has made a huge difference in my life. one 50mg pill a day and i have not had a single uti in over 5 years.	1
187499	after having been misdiagnosed with a yeast infection, diagnosed with bv, treated with metronidazole gel and then developing a yeast infection because of the gel, i've been three weeks with pants of fire. if you're reading this, you might know the feeling. i did three doses of diflucan and no relief. dizziness and general crummy feeling, but still burning and itching. one dose of m3 and i thought i was in heaven. no burning. it was relief within an hour (and i was terrified of all the burning reviews). not everyone reacts the same. one day and i'm looking forward to dose 2. the cooling effect is wearing off and i want this thing gone. monistat 3 cream was my savior!	1
190700	the second day of taking zetia i had night leg cramps (charlie's horse). the third night, same thing, leg cramps at night. the fourth night foot and leg cramps at night. stopped taking them after fourth night.	0
2499	i switched to camrese because my last birth control was giving me consistent debilitating migraines during the week of my period or if i forgot a pill. it was too unbearable to experience that every month. i'm now on my second pack of camrese/month 4 and so far it has been great. i enjoy only having to deal with getting my period every 3 months and i haven't had a migraine yet. spotting happened for a short while in the beginning but it went away. no weight gain. i have been feeling more depressed just recently, but it's hard to know if it's the bc or situational. i'll be following up with my doctor.	1
231799	i have been taking trazodone off and on, more on since 1995. my dose has always been 1 or 2 @ 150mgs. i would never change. i have ddd, djd, arthritis, muscle spasms, chronic pain, copd, asthma, cfs, and nerve damage. what can i say. my mind never turns of. when i tried to get help, i was told it could not be done. i was on a muscle relaxer and my insurance wanted me to try something else, so now i wake-up in the middle of the night. i am also on oxycontin 40mgs for pain, trazodone has been a life saver. i just wish i could find away to stop pain. just don't know what will happen.	1
40623	great medicine. i have herniated discs and take it with percocet, and am able to relax.	1
12171	honestly, this medicine has been life changing for me. before i used it, my acne was awful, mostly on my forehead but all around the rest of my face, too. my dermatologist prescribed it to me and within a month of using it my acne completely cleared up. now three years later, i still use it and my face remains acne free!	1
155948	great great great product. who ever invented this should be eligible for all awards in this universe as the inventor making men active in 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or 70..	1
158034	have taken three different drugs of the same nature and purpose. this has the mildest side effects. nausea, sweats, insomnia, headache, joint pain, increased appetite, lethargy, dizziness are some of the side effects i am experiencing.	0
5205	orsythia was also given to me in place of my usual lutera. i have never experienced side effects of any kind with lutera, but orsythia has caused me to have frequent headaches, moodiness, and full-blown menstruation in the second week of active pills.	0
205277	i was prescribed pristiq about 6 months ago and am currently on the highest dose. it took me awhile to commit to taking it because the side effects were awful. headaches, groggy feeling, dry mouth, and constipation. i've been on it consistently now and the only difference i see is that i feel more numb. i still feel and think the same but my outbursts have calmed down since the medicine makes me so exhausted. i have also gained a lot of weight from this medication. the good part about this medicine for me is i get coupons for it and basically get it for free.	0
223309	i had first hive outbreak at age 63, off and one, lasting for a year. i visited the allergy doctor once and was advised to &quot;enjoy life more and don't do too much! it could be stress-related&quot;. i did not take any medicine. then for one and half a year, i was fine. for the recent 3 months, i have been suffering from the second chronic hive outbreak. they are acting up on my face, lips, eyes, and face which are new and more severe symptoms. at the same time, my older son had the same outbreak and has been taking zyrtec daily by his doctor's recommendation. i have been asking a total of 13 pills from him. firstly i took one a day for 4 days. they were very effective on me. each pill can stop the hives for 3 days.	1
71854	made me very ill after one tablet. vomiting for 24 hrs. tried it again in case it was just a bug and again ill for 24hrs. not for me	0
123063	the doctor didn't warn mean it was putting dog steroid ointment in my eye so i had no choice to continue using it :/ i was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis and the doctor told me to put the ointment 2x a day for 7-10 days..pharmacist said 5-7 so idk i'm gonna stop at 5 because i'm scared of using this it makes my eyes really dry and whole eyelid greasy/sticky :(	0
122241	there's no such thing as complete relief, but this drug gave me the best that i've experienced.	1
140066	this is an exceptional medicine. i have been on it for only a couple of weeks. i have tried seroquel, trazodone, ambien and none of these have worked but alprazolam is a miracle medicine.	1
221419	bottle impossible to open without vice grip pliers. diagram on the bottle lid is completely useless. it indicates &quot; 1.push down and 2. turn anticlockwise&quot; but will not open with these manipulations. possible that i got a bottle from a defective batch in manufacturing (bar code 3 63824 21366 8), made in england, where the qc is much better than in, say, china. written instructions on the peel to read label would be useful. also why not add a trivial amount of sucrose such as 1 gram (1/100th of the carbs in one slice of bread) instead of toxic/carcinogenic/laxative edta, benzoate, propylene glycol, propyl gallate, sorbitol, sucralose, and beet color instead of fd&amp;c red #40? the anhydrous citric acid would suffice as a nontoxic preservative.	0
161851	i took this med for an uti and i developed a severe chronic back pain i also still have abdominal pain.	0
204024	i had chest pain and palpitations. was prescribed imdur and took 1 tablet. that was the worst 3 days of my life. i prefer the angina to the &quot;cure.&quot; caused nausea, vomiting, intense pain (felt like my body was made of broken glass), every sound went right thru me, and every noise was excruciating. never again.	0
138185	i've been using this product for almost 3 months. i'm still having the side effects of starting this new method. but i have lost 5 pounds since i started using ortho evra. my only problem is. i can't tan. my doctor did not tell me i wasn't supposed to get a tan well when i got out. i had the worst mood swings ever. also i wake up every hour of the night throwing up from 3-9 in the morning. it's absolutely horrible because vomiting is one of my main fears. other than that i do love this product and i am disappointed that i have to switch to ortho tri-cyclen because tanning is more important to me right now.	1
218313	i was given amox 500mg/clavulan 125mg to be taken 3 times a day for 10 days for bronchitis at a walk-in clinic. the 3rd day into this rx i developed severe uncontrollable watery diarrhea 45 times a day, by day 6, i stopped taking the rx. i went for weeks with severe diarrhea this rx wiped out all my gut flora, clostridium difficile attacked my large intestine and colon. it took 4 months of antibiotics &amp; living on a brat diet to get this under some control to a point where i am only be having diarrhea 8-10 times per day, for the past 20 months, my body still doesn't know how to form a stool. i live with c. difficile. my gp will not prescribe me any antibiotics at all now. clavulan has destroyed my body!	0
118295	i just spent six years in the penitentiary, as an ex drug addict this shot was offered to me as an option and alternative to other opiate blockers. so far i have taken two of the injections one while in prison and the second as i left the facility. so far so good. some minor joint pain and a few aches. they were able to be worked thru with a little walkin and exercise. no cravings and definitely no thoughts about tryin any opiates after seeing the results first hand. the withdrawal it causes is life threatening. its not worth it.the nanoxolene is good for our situations. if you really want to get clean give it a whirl!	1
168917	this medicine was a disaster for me. i was doing fine on celexa, but my primary doctor started me on viibryd. i had crying spells and was short tempered and unpleasant. so i saw another doctor and he advised that i get off - but phasing out gradually. it took me months to get back to normal. it totally ruined a european trip i had been looking forward to during the cold long winter of 2012/13. needless to say, i dropped this doctor.	0
212727	this medicine helped sedate me when i was having back pain. i had two herniated discs and it calmed me down before and after the surgeries. it is not habit forming and was a plus with all the other medicines i was on.	1
148721	i am 25 and got my minera a little over a month ago. i have a very high pain tolerance, but i won't lie to insertion hurt a lot, but i also haven't had children. i spotted bad for two weeks, and then that stopped, now i just get random cramps sometimes, but nothing compared to the disabling cramps i got while on the pill. my random back pain has also almost completely gone away. i feel like i have come out of a brain fog and can think better. i am no longer crying at everything and feel much more myself--even my husband has mentioned i seem more myself. i also have much more of a libido now--my husband loves it. we aren't ready for kids yet, so not having to remember to take a pill every days has really helped me not stress over sex.	1
32364	my doctor prescribed medication for me 3 weeks ago. first chlorthaladone and it turned my stool into a solid brick. finally passed stool but with incredible pain. doctor then changed med to lisinopril. after 1 week i saw the doctor and said the same condition of severe constipation existed. doctor said that lisinopril was not cause of constipation and said to use miralax for a week. after 5 days, miralax did nothing. i called the doctor and told of this experience. the doctor still thinks the bowel problem is unrelated to the medication. but said stop for a week, track blood pressure and see if bowel trouble continues. i get the impression that the doc and nurse think i am crazy and should not question anything. i am not crazy.	0
88625	i wish i would've read this group prior to starting my prep. i've had crohn's disease for 19 years and have had numerous colonoscopies. currently, i'm in good health and my colonoscopy tomorrow (hopefully is just routine. preponik sounded promising. less nasty liquid to drink. hooray. except that i drank magnesium citrate at 7pm last night and preponik at 9am and 4pm with more than the recommended amount of clear fluids and hardly anything has happened. it's now 6:15pm and i just talked to my gi and had to drink an extra bottle of magnesium citrate (a fleet enema doesn't clear our the upper colon). if it doesn't clear out by 2am, i can't do the colonoscopy tomorrow. seriously?!	0
159136	i was on trinessa for a little under a year. i threw up during the first week of each pack and i was so emotional. i could hardly function both physically and mentally. i don't know how i made it to school and passed during the first week of the pack and i could not make it to work during the first week of each pack. the second week i was just plain exhausted and could not do much either. the doctor kept telling me those symptoms would go away. i finally called up there as one crying angry woman and they finally changed it for me. i feel great and back to normal now.	0
108235	i just started the 2 pills in the morning and one pill at night today. i have had no effects whatsoever other than feeling tired. i have lost no weight and am hungry all the time. i will continue it but not for much longer, very disappointed.	0
134149	low back pain radiating down legs and shoulder pain. i have been in severe pain since injuring my back in 2007. i worked in construction and have injured my lower back several times. mri revealed bulging disc from l1 to l5 and shoulder pain is from years of heavy work. i have been going to pain clinics since 2008 and although i take pain medication it does little to relieve the pain. my pcp prescribed prednisone tablets for 20 days along with a shot to start with. within three days my pain had decreased and within a week i was almost pain free. for the first time in years i spent a week without pain medicine. i took the last of the prednisone last week and the pain in my lower back and shoulder returned yesterday and by this morning i am using a walker again.	1
94861	i heard voices and experienced wild delusions for over ten years before i found abilify. at first i took 10mg of haldol to quiet the voices but that stopped working after 6 months. and the side effects of haldol were high. my experience with abilify i think are better than average, in that i'm symptom free, with no side effects. 30mg a day for three years.	1
208699	actually came out of hospital, because i have been suffering from long term insomnia and was prescribed belsomra 15mg as a 'last resort' option. in my experiences i have already tried temazepam, valpam, valium, imovane, seroquel (quetiapine) etc. all those drugs eventually just building up my tolerance each time and i become dependent on them to sleep. i however did try the antidepressant valdoxan 25mg (agomelatine). this really helped me for month. my body really built up tolerance to it and eventually i needed 50mg and then it just stopped working for me after 5 months, but i can assure you it reallllllly helped my insomnia for that short 5 months. *will continue in another post*	0
35021	i have been using this for one month. i have had severe constipation, been dizzy and my skin is as bad as ever. not happy.	0
67569	hello ladies, well currently i am waiting the results of plan b since i had an incident this past sun 9/10. so me and my bf always use condoms but this past sunday alcohol was involved so we went ahead and had unprotected sex, he pulled out the first time but there's the matter of precum so of course this was the stupidest decision we both could've made, and i was expected to ovulate 3 days later. so the next morning. i went ahead and bought plan b and took it exactly at 9am (13-15 hours after). so here i am worried to the point of having a panic attack but i'm hopeful cause it's worked for me before! i'll be posting an update in 2 weeks when i take a pregnancy test. good luck!	1
175263	i posted almost 2 months ago. i've been taking mucinex since then for the fibromyalgia pain (i am not a creature of habit and have a hard time remembering to take any medication but i don't miss it!) i can sincerely say that it continues to work - progressively better - and i find it hard to believe it myself! pain in my right shoulder that i've had for over 15 years has quietly disappeared. i no longer sleep with a pillow between my knees, and i have so much less pain bending over, etc. i also don't have to clear my throat constantly in the morning like i did so it works great on mucus too. i really didn't expect the results to continue. if you have pain like me, give it a try. no bad effects. i hope it works for you.	1
16843	copaxone for me was very harsh. before switching i ended up with almost all side effects.	0
187608	i'm from the uk and zovirax cost &pound;6 which is probably $9 for a small little tube, it's rubbish, felt tingle so went straight to the shop and bought zovirax, been applying it every 4-5 hours, 3 days later and the cold sore has blistered at side of my mouth, would of been better using tcp, it burns a bit but it does the job	0
31605	i was midly irritated with a yeast infection. figures it happens over the weekend so no doctor could be seen. so i go to the drugstore and decided i'll play it safe lefts do monistat 7. day one it felt like liquid acid especially outside. i took my other medications and went to sleep, next day still burned but i'm like one more shot at the time i i thought ok the burning will go away and i will be fine. let me tell you my crotch was swollen on fire and left a huge rash across my mid section. i didn't sleep i can't even wear anything because i feel like i was set on fire. doctors didn't know how to cure this basically telling me it's a 50 50 chance prednisone will make this go away or make it worse i am beyond miserable i just want sleep :(	0
168663	been taking viibryd for 2 years now. was only on 10mg first few weeks nausea and loose frequent stools each week thethe symptoms lessen and i could feel the benefits. i was happy and relaxed, no decrease in sex drive and didn't have any of the side effects that i could notice (chronic back pain, gi issues, and difficulty sleeping my whole life). my doctor gives me samples and coupons when he can but it is extremely expensive.	1
206217	ketaconazole cream helped a lot for several years. now i guess i've gotten immune to it. is there anything else i could use?	1
194543	i was taking the combination drug caduet, of which lipitor was one of the two drugs. steadily over a year my doctor increased the medication from 20mg to 40mg, and then about three months ago he increased it to 80mg. within a month i was experienceing severe tiredness, and eventually sever muscle weakness, coupled with elevated ck readings. on doing some research on the drug i found that the symptoms i had were indeed a major drug reaction. although lipitor helped in the reduction of my cholesterol levels, the side effects were debilitating. within a week of having the medication changed to a non-statin i was beginning to feel better. a month later i am close to being back to my old self. there are other better alternatives.	0
9154	only on it two months and its ruined my life. first month was horrible. bad cystic acne (never had acne before this in my life) on my forehead and horrible mood swings. then i got use to the hormones and those symptoms went away. end of my second month i lost tons of hair. i'm talking clumps would fall out. then came the bald spots i freaked and quit the pill that day. now i have to use rogaine and take tons of supplements to treat my hair. my hair was healthy, not chemically touched, long, and full. now its patchy, thin, has broken off, it looks horrible. i had to cut my hair to hide a huge bald patch right where some if my bangs use to be!	0

15909	this is the worst birth control i have ever been on! i am 31 years old and recently had the nexplanon removed. big mistake!!! i never write reviews but this birth control is the devil!! while on the nexplanon i never had cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, or horrible mood swings. glidess i have all these symptoms plus paranoia, and depression. i have been taking these pills for a month and half and never have felt more insecure in my life. the weight gain is an issue as well, i gained 12 pounds within the 1st month. i realized that this birth control was making me feel crazy, anxious and not myself so i made an app.t for my obgyn for a better option. i cant wait to throw these pills down the drain. hope this is helpful.	0
61689	17 days on citalopram 20 mg for depression. citalopram helps remember things and helps with ocd. i no longer have forgot my keys on the apt door or forgot to lock my car. it really has helped my brain deliver messages where they belong. i have lost weight at least one size. the first three days were the worse. with a type of stoned feeling over-sleeping but after the first week, i began to feel more alert and definitely less worried. i was always worried about things that didn't matter or wernt real before taking citalopram. citalopram makes me feel i have control over my depression and not the other way around. but i don't have the energy to workout like before i was taking it. and it takes longer for me to climax. it elevates your mood t	1
32033	i really wanted wellbutrin to work. i was given 150 mg once daily. at first it seemed to be helping with minimal side effects, but about 4 or 5 weeks in i was so depressed and not even getting out of bed. i was so agitated, even with the addition of a mood stabilizer. wellbutrin was not a pleasant experience for me.	0
100000	this birth control was so bad that i had to stop after three months. i had a lot of side effects within the past three months, such as terrible acid reflex, nausea, heavy bleeding, migraines, and my face broke out terribly. this was definitely not the birth control for me.	0
34234	i am now 19 years old. 2 years out of high school i severely broke my hand from a fight. i have never felt so much pain in my life. i underwent 3 surgeries, 3 plates and 24 screws later my hand was somewhat normal still a lot of pain. now im getting ready to leave for the united states airforce and can not take narcotic pain medication. my doctor recommended 200mg ultram er. it works wonders and it doesn't show in my drug screening. i never thought i could take one pill a day and be pain free.	1
34409	not effective in lowering blood pressure. side effects: fatigue, shortness of breath, pain in both calves, extreme hot flashes and nausea.	0
160926	not much relief with lots of side effects.	0
206019	i have been on pritiq for about 2 months now and it has been going pretty good. i will say that i went on a trip and forgot my medication and within the first 2 days i slept 20 hours straight and i had bad mood changes. when i came home i went right back on it and have had no problems since. i have no appetite and have lost about 15 - 20 pounds. it makes me feel much more awake. i am on the lowest dosage and with these results i have no desire to increase my dosage.	1
85624	i have been bleeding constantly, to the point i can't even have sex. it's like i'm constantly on my period i am switching as soon as i get the chance!!	0

204514	i did not like this. i was given this for anxiety and it didnt help at all. i tried it for a month and felt no difference.	0
8462	it's not working. i still stay up or get up 5 to 6 time a night.	0
104106	i just started this pill a week ago, so far it has increased my appetite. i love it! since i rapidly lost weight this summer due to depression. i'm no longer depressed and my sex drive increased. plus i have a fast metabolism so it's perfect so far. good luck!!!	1
144323	i've had my nexplanon implant for about 2 years now, and i love it! i used to get depo shots regularly which worked for me, but it was not always convenient to have to go to pp to regularly get them. since i had such positive experiences with the depo (including completely stopped periods), i was recommended the nexplanon and it's been a great fit! i've never had children and never plan to. i'd like to have my tubes tied, but i think i would still keep the implant just due to the positive effects it has on my body. my periods used to be awful, leaving me stuck in bed with horrendous cramps and migranes. i would be in a lot of pain, my mood would be erratic and generally terrible, and the bleeding was uncontrollable. no more!	1
224900	have been using nicotine patches for awhile now and cut myself back to 6 a day. started zyban 7 days ago taking 150 mg. for 3 days then 300. now, am back up to 10-13 per day. they have started tasting funky just a little bit though. but that's only sometimes. sometimes, after 1/2 the cig. taste is bad. but going from 6 to 12 or 13 is depressing me. having agitation moments as well and trouble going to sleep. i'm wondering if desire for them will go away after awhile.	0

106042	eighteen year old female, just started taking strattera on thanksgiving. slept through the entire day and night, had lucid dreams, woke up angry and crying. i tried it a second day, friday, and managed to stay awake (more due to the fact that i was reading a good book). i refused to take it on saturday because i was visiting family and i didn't want to be moody or drowsy around people that i get to see maybe twice a year. took it again this morning, barely managed to finish a short story before falling asleep in the car, which i have never done before. still feeling the effects of it right now, got yelled at for falling asleep, still moody, still have homework to do. i'll check back in a few days after school.	0
49997	gabapentin has been amazing for me! i have been battling bi polar my whole life. i am 50 now and have been on several antidepressants for the last 5 years. nothing really helped. for the last couple years, i would wake up crying for no reason and not wanting to get out of bed. the last time i went to see my doc she asked me if bi polar ran in my family. i told her i wasn't sure but though there might be. she put me on 300 mg. the first morning i woke up after taking the med, it had an overnight result! i did not cry and was able to get out of bed easier. i was amazed that my life changed so much in one day! i highly recommend anyone suffering from bi polar to try this med.	1
91572	this medicine leaves me feeling exceptionally dizzy and off balance. after seven months it is doing nothing to help me walk.	0
225944	given zyban to help me stop smoking and it worked. i quit smoking, drinking tea and sodas too. to this day i do not want to smoke or drink tea or sodas. i didn't know that i would feel so good too. i didn't feel depressed anymore. i felt content with life. the only draw back i experienced was some dizziness.	1
223707	i had head to toe hives for the last 3-4 years. antihistamines did nothing. after my first shot of xolair, the hives went away for about 3 months. then after the 4th shot, they came back and stayed with me for another 3 months. i just had my ninth shot and i've been hive free for 3 months. i've put on weight that i can't explain and i'm having more foods give me gas. these are not good side effects but better than the constant itching.	1
2981	it was really early in the morning, and i went to take tylenol, when i misread the directions. i meant to measure out two tablespoons of the drug, but accidentally used my measuring cup instead. i ended up chugging two cups of tylenol instead! i was rushed to the hospital and given mucomyst-10 to offset the effects. mucomyst-10 saved my life. thank you mucomyst-10!	1
69949	i have been on it for 2 yrs cd4 900-1000, undetectable viral load. started at 356 cd4 &amp; 27k viral load. have not noticed any side effects, i take it before bed at night. missed 1 dose in two yrs so i have good adherence which you need for any of the antiviral medicines to work.	1
207341	horrible horrible stuff! i barely got the first half down and fought back throwing it up all night long. there was no way i could do the second half the next morning. thank god the first half was enough to do the trick. you would think that by now, with as routine as this procedure has become, someone would have come up with a prep that doesn't make you wish for death.	0
221635	used this with clindamycin lotion for neck and back acne. within days had bad diarrhea. be very careful.	0
161929	put on 30 days cipro 1000mg/day for suspected prostatitis based on pain during rectal exam, all other symptoms had gone away by the time i saw urologist. day5 i took the pill my feet and ankles swelled up and it was very difficult to drive my car or climb stairs. a few days later, one of my ankles is still tight and the foot on that side tingles when walking around. hopefully these side effects will go away. prior to starting i did have pain in my left abdomen and a heavy feeling in my left testicle, and these seemed to go away 3 or 4 days into the treatment, so i cant say the medicine didn't work at all. i am left hoping this tendon pain in my feet will subside and i can return to usual activity. was told to never take cipro again.	0
52018	didn't like the caffeine addition of this medication, it kept me awake at night, however, it did significantly help my headaches. very thankful for the relief!	1
110309	i got my implant in september 2014. in the beginning, i experienced irregular periods, but nothing too alarming. things started to get bad towards the end of january 2015. i started gaining weight, tired all the time, and my sex drive is almost non existent! i've gained 23lbs since then, and no matter how hard i try, i can't lose it, and just keep getting heavier. i have a ridiculously large appetite, and my acne has become painful and very obvious. i'm not myself anymore. when i'm not working (which i do every day, very physically active job), all i want to do is lay down and do nothing. i never used to be like this. i'm bleeding almost constantly, and my memory is shot. i want this thing out!	0

214183	made it worse. had a little bit of yeast but after taking the product i gained more yeast and a smell.	0
108572	i weighed 163lbs when i started this medicine. i dropped 10lb during the first month. i also started medicines for thyroid issues, so that might be part of it. however, my cravings are completely gone! the medicine also helps a bit with my depression, and i feel more determined to work out. i'm pretty happy with it.	1
3351	fever chills fatigue headache pounding heartbeat chest pains and ached all over- i will never take this again!	0
15143	i was originally prescribed this pill to help with fainting spells on my period, irregular periods, severe cramps, and the impression that i might have had endometriosis. shortly after starting, about a month in, my mood severely changed. i would get anxious very easily over little things. within the past month(i haven't even been taking this pill for 2 full months), i have experienced insane emotional breakdowns resulting from either overthinking situations, or no trigger at all. within the past 3 weeks, i have cried nearly everyday. although, i have not experienced any pain from my period, it is virtually nonexistent. as for other side effects, this pill, despite popular belief, has not a learned my skin.	0
210096	after a couple of stays in the hospital for constipation this year, after taking narcotics while recovering from neck surgery. i also have been chronically constipated for many years, i was prescribed linzess. i have been on linzess for a month now. i am regular for the first time in 10 yrs. everyday. it did take a week or two to get over my body adjusting, and not having to stay home for the run to the bathroom, things are calmer now. my stomach pain is also much better, as is the distension. i feel great. huge fan of linzess!	1
163415	my 4yr old son has autism/adhd/ocd. after coming off of risperidone my sons' neurologist wanted to try my son on quillivant xr. our pharmacy had to special order this med due to there was nobody else in this county that takes it. the 1st dose of this med that my son took he went wild!!! he got violent with us, and just refused to eat anything, he was also up for 22hr straight! he only had 2 doses of this med (day 1 &amp; 2) then i had to call his dr and to have him taken off the med. we ended up going back on risperidone and guanfacine. once i stopped giving my son the quillivant xr med he started acting like his old self again.	0
85715	i have only been on this pill for one cycle, but it seems as if my acne is worse. i was put on trinessa solely for my acne and now i'm considering stopping. i have read reviews and the vast majority of those reviews mention a huge flare-up in their acne, just as i have, which makes me think that this isn't unusual. i really want to stick with it, but i'm not sure my self-confidence can handle it.	0
219725	i was prescribed amitriptyline for insomnia after having a negative experience with taking ambien. ambien worked fine until its side effects kicked in then i stopped taking it because the side effects were unreasonable. amitriptyline helped me sleep until one night i awoke to buzzing in my ears/head. from reasoning there might be lifelong buzzing in my head i discontinued the amitriptyline. shortly after discontinuing the buzzing went away and never returned. bottome line: there are much better oral's to take to assist in sleeping. i feel amitriptyline did however correct a brain imbalance that was produced by the ambien; and i found the culprit to my insomnia: i have an adrenaline allergy, from stress, anxiety and screen-time.	0
72694	pros: i'm not pregnant, my periods are lighter, and the pills were free. cons: i've been on it 4 months. the first month i had terrible cramping. i had to stay home from work to writhe on my bed. i also already struggle with depression, and it seemed to exacerbate my depressive feelings. i've also been abnormally angry and irritable. it finally got so bad last week that i went off of it. i've also had lower back/hip muscle/joint pain since a month after starting birth control. i believe it's related. i'm too afraid to get on another hormonal pill. they always say it takes a few months for your body to get used to the hormones! meanwhile you're a trainwreck. i can't afford these emotional (or physical) side effects.	0
108034	i've been on the birth control patch for over a year now, i love it! never had really bad side effects , my periods would come on time , never had problems with the patch coming off. there are however some side effects i didn't know about, spotting in between periods, feeling nausea , headaches , etc. but all in all i love the patch! not planning on getting pregnant anytime soon!	1
95801	im 22 on day 5 of 25mg zoloft. tried prozac before and it made me feel numb kind of zombie like. zoloft is helping my mood, but i cant sleep at all, if i do manage to fall asleep i wake up an hour later. i clench my teeth and constantly need to move my legs at night. feel slightly confused at times. im hoping these side effects go away	1
155217	negative. prescribed for dry socket after tooth extraction. terrible side effects, dizzy,tired but worse still feeling sick all the time stopping short of actually being sick due to sheer willpower as i detest being sick! pain off the scale, back to the dentist!	0
87509	girls... if you want to be able to function and actually get out of bed this is the solution for you. i have unbearable cramps to where i'm stuck in bed and cry all day from the pain. i've tried everything over the counter and nothing has worked. i was prescribed the 550 mg and my life has changed. even though there are times where i still have pain it's not as bad as it was. i don't experience any real side effects except sometimes i get a little tired, but it's not horrible.	1
196205	absolutely amazing! i was in a terrible spot with my harm ocd..... and then this miracle of a drug came along! it's almost like its a physical volume knob that turns your thoughts down... to the point where they are still there, but so quiet they're insignificant. only reason i gave it a 9/10 is because it took a while to work.... but that's different for everyone. if you're reading this and are wondering if it's going to even work... i have been on it for a solid 8 weeks, and i'm just now starting to feel the effects. i literally have trouble falling asleep now, only because i'm excited about tomorrow! :)	1

66313	i have unfortunately been suffering from cold sores since my first outbreak when i was 1 year old and being 34 now a lot has changed. back in my younger years i was bullied because of these sores that would appear around my mouth. carmex or blistex did not work and lysine only assisted a bit. when abreva came out $30 a small tube back then i jumped at the chance to try it and it did help me keep the blisters in one area instead of them spreading more. it wasn't until a year ago &quot;seriously&quot; that i finally brought something up to my doctor who told me about valtrex and i was under the impression this was for genital herpes only. living in hot az has been tough on handling my outbreaks but with valtrex i can manage them more and love that	1
183878	magic. i actually used it for congestion/flu.	1
209491	i was taken off of suboxone and put on zubsolv and it was terrible. they tell you more of the medicine is absorbed so the actual mg is lower than suboxone or subutex. i was ok during the day but, by the time bed time rolled around, i felt the affects of the medicine wearing off. i even kept it in my mouth for 20 minutes. still didn't last very long. i'm now taking subutex and feel much better! didn't work for me, may work for some!	0
150415	side effects: extreme exhaustion extreme irritability inability to concentrate nausea itching &amp; skin peeling @ site of finger infection vaginal spotting body aches severe headaches rx was for 2x a day for 10 days for severe infection on end of finger with red streaks completed medicine because infection was healing but side effects were substantial !	1
156750	i took trulicity for 4 weeks. .75 dose sugar levels went down immediatly. to morning levels average of 140. only side effects were pain in side from stomach to back, pain and swollen lump in front on side of neck to my ear. pain in back was not too bad. pain in tyroid gland of my neck was severe. _stopped taking it and pain in back went away. however the pain both side of neck was really severe and it's been 3 weeks and i still have the pain. bad luck with victoza and trulicity.	0
81410	i have been on yaz for 8 months now. the first 2 were a little rough with breakthrough bleeding or missed period (which is so stressful) but i gave it a chance anyway. i had mild to severe acne that is very much clear now other than a few scars. i have not gained weight but my breast are a full cup size bigger. my only issue with yaz is that i never used to get pms symptoms, now i feel angry and the next second i want to cry for absolutely not reason. this only lasts a day or two so i can deal with it.	1
84798	i found that so far, this birth control has been right for me. i think the key is taking it as soon as you wake up (easiest for me since i'm up at the same time daily). i did notice that i had a break out during this first month. seemed to have eased my cramps when it came to my period. i still don't have unprotected sex , so i'm not sure of its effectiveness against pregnancy within my body. it's cheap. that's a huge plus, 8 dollars a month with my insurance. i also notice that it made my breasts hurt tremendously during the first few weeks . there are some side effects that come with this medication but i can deal with that instead of worrying about pregnancy. i would recommend others trying it just to see how it works with your body :)	1
96709	i have severe eczema. prednisone or tacrolimus will clear me up but steroid topical medications only help a little. i was excited to hear about a new treatment. the tube cost 80.00 after insurance. i didn't notice any pain or discomfort but i didn't notice any positive effect either. it did nothing for my itch. i decided to try it on one leg with triamcinolone ointment on the other. the triamcinolone worked noticeably better. i did not refill my prescription.	0
85363	i absolutely hate this birth control. not only do i get the heaviest periods i've ever gotten in my life (i have to change my super plus tampons every couple of hours the first couple days), it sometimes comes a week early. also, weight gain, some acne (which i never experienced my whole life) and terrible pms. only reason i'm giving it some &quot;stars&quot; is because i didn't get pregnant.	0
79406	i'm 22 years old, it was my first time using any type of pill, i was really worried i'd be getting pregnant after i had sex. so the next day i woke up like super early in the morning and i went to target and i got this plan b pill. but before buying it, i searched all over the internet so see the reviews and side effects and all that. i went home and that day i really didn't eat anything because i was feeling low. like i wasn't in the mood for anything at that time. so i read that if you don't eat anything that it might make your stomach hurt and all. so i just had a glass of milk and i drank a little bit of water. than i took the pill with water like any regular pill. for me it worked no side effects. :) girls this will help you.	1
101799	i was diagnosed with hyperhidrosis on my hands and feet as a child. growing up with constant sweaty feet, i've battled toe nail fungus since i was about 8/9 years old. i'm 23. today is my first day taking terbinafine, so i'm a little excited and can't wait to see results like most of you have. i have about 5/6 infected toes. 4 are severe. (2 big toes and 2 pinkys) i haven't been able to wear sandals out in public since i was a child. i'll leave another review when treatment is done in 3 months from now.	0
94195	i've been on this med for a while now. the first month was really hard, i didn't see any changes. in fact i felt as bad or worse than before , but by the second month i started to feel better. for me i've noticed that if i take it during the day i have a headache feel fatigued and nauseas and sometimes hot too. so i make sure to take it at night before bed. there are two things i don't care for about this med though: the cost and the weight gain!	1
229795	i started taking it may 2015, then about 6 mos in, the vertigo started and scared the crap out of me, dizziness, constant sinus drainage, so then the cough, dizzy at times, strange taste in my mouth but the worst was the ringing and another weird noise in my head, it would wake me up in the morning,like morse code. then the clogged feeling in my head, my heart pounding in my chest and head, so as of right now i am just on hct, hoping this will just help. really really bad side effects on this drug. would take it at night, and would be peeing all night, as to avoid the side effects oh and the blurred vision problems also	0
33218	i have been taking microgestin for three months now. it's birth control. sure, everyone needs to find the right one for them but it really isn't as horrid as everyone is making it... side effects happen.. you're pumping your body full of hormones. for the first month i didn't break out a tad bit more than usual, my boobs were extremely tender and i was feeling lethargic but around the end of month 2 my face became extra clear, my boob tenderness had subsided and i have my energy back! give your body time to become adjusted. . that's it. do that and you will be a okay side effect and baby free.	1
177933	i&rsquo;m a type 1 diabetic for 39 years. had very painful muscle spasms/seizing and twitching. i tried various supplements which &quot;should&quot; have helped but no improvement. i started neurontin at 1,800mg/day and i had terrible swelling plus gained 18 lbs in 6 months (and my eating habits actually got better while on it). the 1,800mg of neurontin no longer controlled the muscle spasms. i started cymbalta, 30 mg before bed, and had significant reduction in pain the first morning. i did notice a very strong headache that first day. i had only 3-4 muscle spasms that first day as well....wow!! second day...almost no pain in the morning and only a dull headache with much weaker muscle spasms. side effects: crazy dreams, difficulty sleeping, headache.	1
45233	i am beginning my fourth week on 20mg fluoxetine taken each morning. i am recovering from a long term abusive relationship with a narcissist. i have a head injury that predisposes me to fatigue. i asked the doctor to help me with my energy levels. i did not admit it but the underlying feeling i had was that 'everything was too much' and 'nothing matters anyway'. but nobody would have guessed how hopeless i had become. and had been for at least 10 years. initially i experienced all of the symptoms people warn about in the first few weeks. insomnia and occassional extreme anxiety were the worst. now i feel enthused about taking things one at a time and am enjoying the process. i have begun to sleep normally again. so far, so good.	1
192831	i was on yaz for a year trying to let my body get used to it. it made me depressed and made my pms even worse accompanied with headaches. it made my period irregular (twice a month and heavy). it did help my acne, i'll give it credit for that but on it i gained about 20 pounds and it's been really hard to take that weight off.	0
51490	worked great in the beginning for a month or so, but that was about it. even with my excellent insurance, this wasn't covered, but i was given a coupon which made it free. if not, it would've been in the $300 range. that aside, i used all the samples i got and i saw some results, so i filled the prescription. long story short, i saw no lasting effects. the good about this, there was no burning, peeling, etc. out of all the acne creams i used, which is a lot over the course of 10-15 years, tazoratene worked best.	0
43469	worked very well for me after abdominal surgery. it was given to me through a pain pump, it was great because i could sleep and rest.	1
114521	took this medication to help my svt. made my heart skip beats and i felt like i was going to have a heart attack. worst experience of my life. never helped lower my heart rate. lopressor never worked for me either.	0
143755	when i was 19 i developed pulmonary blood clots as a result of using traditional birth control pills, and so i cannot use many types of hormone based birth control methods. i tried the paragard iud, which was miserable (awful cramping/ super heavy periods.) so, i had that removed about a year after it was inserted. after a year of just using condoms, i went back to my gyn to see if i had any other options. this is when she pointed me into the direction of nexplanon. i had it implanted in june of this year. i haven't had a period since. a little spotting in the beginning, but nothing major. its been great. the only thing is that i have had a little random cramping, but nothing ibuprofen can't fix. i love it, but will update if that changes.	1
172550	i take klonopin for anxiety, 2 mg - 4 mg per day as situationally needed. it is not habit forming and i have no side effects. i can go several days without needing it, then when i do it's very helpful to bring calm and relaxation and significantly reduce depression. i think some people on here are confusing the side effects of lexapro and other ssris commonly prescribed along with klonopin. more than likely it's the ssris that are causing the nasty side effects and withdrawal symptoms, as i went through that myself when i stopped taking the anti-depressants. i find klonopin by itself to be high effective without any negative effects, and i have stopped all other ssris because of their sexual side effects and worsening of depression.	1
227132	i had severe mood swings while on this medication. my periods were heavy, irregular, my cramps were painful it was truly an awful experience. i had it in for the full three years, and although it did its job of preventing pregnancy, since i've been off it for three months i have never felt better. i lost the 20 pounds i gained on this medicine.	0
223325	zyrtec is the only medicine that controls my allergy symptoms, but it makes me so tired, sleepy and i always seem to be &quot;zoning out&quot;. i even passed a red light at an intersection a few days ago...thankfully no one was hurt.	1
15166	i like one of the other reviewers has taken nortrel 1/35 in place of necon 1/35 due to lack of med at the pharmacy. i was told that it's literally the same thing but a different company. i am so glad that i stumbled across this forum because it explains the abnormal symptoms that i'm experiencing. i've been taking it 2 weeks today. the past few days i haven't had an appetite at all. i have to force myself to eat. also, complete loss of interest in sex. as a newlywed...not a good thing. i also noticed the dryness with sex as well which has never been a problem for me. i will be stopping this med immediately! the pros are not worth the cons.	0
48755	at first i thought i loved this pill, the problem with it crept in so subtly i didn't notice it (very similar to a previous complaint on saw on here). i've never had issues with anxiety or depression before taking this. about 7 months into taking the pill my anxiety sky rocketed and i became increasingly depressed. insomnia also became a consistent problem and i seriously thought i was losing my mind. my relationship with my husband also suffered from these serious side effects as i became extremely moody and would cry for no reason and not understand why. my advice would be to seriously monitor how you feel while on this pill and note any changes in mood - becomes it definitely creeps in slowly.	0
4785	i was so excited about it at first and i am on day 5 of the trial. i do not feel a difference. i don't feel that it takes my appetite away at all. am i doing something wrong? i want it to work very badly. i take one in morning and the other around 3:00pm. i walk for an hour everyday after work also.	0
13692	my son was 7 when he started taking adderall for his aspergers syndrome. he was overweight but after taking the medication for 1.5 years, lost a lot of weight. he is not a picky eater but his appetite was non-existent. there was nothing i could do to get him to eat. we did have to change his medicines and he has since put some weight back on. the medicine did do for us what we needed it to do which was help with his impulsivity.	0
23791	bad experience causes extreme restless leg syndrome and back aches, taste horrible also , only been on 20 mgs a day for 3 weeks so hopefully not much withdrawals i'm stopping cold turkey as i need my sleep gonna dry bendryl as i think its a allergic reaction. would never take again.	0
217635	might work for others, but i came down with most of the adverse side effects within hours of taking one 500mg tab. ended up in emergency 12 hours later with difficulty breathing from swollen airways. hives. scary part was how it can effects the mind. i had residual effects for a number of days.	0
164988	im always leary about primary care providers pushing weight loss med like belviq and qysmia and insulin pens that make you lose weight after all what incentives are they getting from the company ? the upside to this medicine is the trial basis took care of my cervical neck pain but the combination of the meds was a disaster. i felt moody, irritable, anxious, depressed, hopeless, tingly all over, headaches, nauseated, thirsty, never hungry thanks to nausea, sleeplessness, wired!!! and tired!!! odd sensations, cold and heat intolerance, panic, blurred vision. no thanks i would rather be fat and happy ! i was eating healthy and drinking only water but was unable to lose the weight. this is a horrible medicine!!	0
194808	have reduced my seizures from about 15 a year to only 3-4 a year, however the side effects greatly outweigh the benefits. currently suffering and have been for about 6 years now... extreme fatigue, mood swings, high up and down rapid changing moods, anger with extreme anger outbursts where never in my life was i an angry person, shaky hands, extreme memory loss like 2-4 month gaps, unable to concentrate, irritability, can't even remember simple names of things like cup or brush which is very frustrating because i use to be a grant writer and loved to write poetry can't anymore. stuffy nose, exaggerated fears, swollen glands, depressed, social anxiety, i rarely leave my home anymore, i don't answere the phone, dr. doesn't care	0
229813	after taking this medication for approximately 3-4 days i had wheezing and difficulty breathing. please be mindful of all side effects.	0
231099	only the 4th day and can't sleep due to rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. very dizzy and nauseous. panic attacks due to the side effect of this drug. feel terrible.	0
104243	at first this pill made me miserable. i had the worst mood swings and took it out on everyone around me. i stopped taking it after one month, but then i tried it again a few months later and nothing bad happened. you just need to give your body enough time to get used to it. no weight gain, no mood swings (by the second month), no breast changes, etc. my face isn't totally clear of acne and my period cramps/flow is only a little less, but this is a good pill if you just want the basics without altering your body.	1
91352	i was prescribed haldol for aggression (agitation) when i was hospitalized for bipolar disorder. the psychiatrist i had had a very abrasive personality and prescribed it after i hauled off on staff without telling me anything about it, not even the name. i became extremely shaky, could not hold my head up, was very drowsy and just couldn't function. i literally screamed at my doctor to take me off of it when he gave me something to counteract the shakiness. i was fine then. when i was discharged he was going to give me straight haldol, but i argued with him (and won).	0
90087	i went to my doctor for general eye irritation and most likely an incorrect fitting of my current contacts which is causing eye irritation. i was prescribed lotemax, 1 drop in each eye, 4 x day. obviously lotemax is a steriod. i have no history of anxiety or mental illness. after first day i noticed i was having weird thoughts that i couldn't get out of my head. in the days that followed, i started to have severe anxiety with full blown panic attacks. i was scared to be around my husband and my children worried that i might cause them harm or them harming themselves, or somehow being subjected to harm... my worst fear. i was manic with worry and paranoia and cried repeatedly. i stopped the meds and the symptoms started to disappear.	0
110890	i find maxair to be very helpful for my asthma.	1
221019	my obgyn switched me to junel 1.5/30 after taking sprintec for 4 months. the sprintec was fine, except i noticed breakouts. i now realize that the breakouts were due to a skincare product, and that switching to junel is the worst thing that's happened to me. i have constant mood swings, i cry all the time for no reason, i have a constant throbbing headache, i have no sex drive whatsoever, my appetite has changed, and somehow my breasts got smaller.. i stopped taking it and i'm switching back to sprintec as soon as i can. horrible, horrible birth control.	0
155938	i am a 34 year old teacher from east london. i took cialis 25mg at 9pm and i managed to get a rock hard erection which lasted nearly 24 hours. my wife also felt a remarkable difference and i was able to handle vaginal sex 3 times. great.	1
181019	i have allergic conjunctivitis and it made my eyes feel much better - not so itchy, red and swollen.	1
106838	i have had this in for about 2.5 years. it works in that i have not gotten pregnant. i have a very light period for 1-2 weeks every month or so. sometimes 6 weeks in between 'periods,' sometimes only 2 weeks. it's very unpredictable, can ruin a lot of 'underclothes'. also, i cannot get back to my pre-birth control weight. i used to weigh an athletic 145 with a diet of whatever i felt like eating and exercise 4 days a week. maybe its age, but now 2.5 years later, i can exercise 6 days a week for twice as long, and watch what i eat and am stuck at 154.	1
228036	i had implanon fitted 6 years ago after an unwanted pregnancy. i've had no side effects until now. my second implant is now at an end. i only realized it was running out because in the last couple of months i've had really irregular periods so went to the doctor. i've got to wait a week until they can remove it and put a new one in, but the stomach cramps are now really unbearable. but i will still be having another put in since the cramps are apparently down to it running out. also, some confusion with the medicine modafinil. this site says it is not compatible. but both my doctor and gyno say it's okay.	1
171393	was started on wellbutrin 150mg for one month. made me sleep and eat less but did nothing for my depression so my doctor increased it to 300mg. within 3 to 4 days of the increase, i was having panic attacks and couldn't stop crying. depression kicked into overdrive immediately.	0
18406	i have been using this medication for 12 years. it gives me great relief. i take it 2x daily and if i miss a dose i know it in a few hours. without it i have back pain and begin to limp.	1
138535	i have just started with phentermine as of this past friday and am now on day 4 today. i had spoken to my doctor about it a month a go and he challenged me to loose some weight on my own first, and i did, 6lbs in a month. my doctor was concerned about my obesity and put me on this and i honestly feel wonderful. my cravings are gone! i work 10 hours a day at a desk job, on the phone and do not get much movement other than my occasional jont to go refill my water or breaks. i feel so great, and i have so much more energy. since friday, i have now lost 3lbs more. i make sure i drink at least half my body weight in oz in water daily if not more and my appetite is nil. i have to make myself remember to eat.	1
50834	i think this stuff really messed up my stomach big time! i started a 5 day treatment on 7/17/17 for a respiratory infection. the stomach problems didn't happen until the last day and to this day (8/13/17) i still seem to be having stomach issues. after doing some internet searching for reviews, i found some that were basically horror stories from people who took this! if this stuff has such horrific side effects, why is it even prescribed and/or why didn't the doctor discuss possible side effects with me beforehand?! and, on top of all of that, i'm still coughing like a crazy person!	0
229351	did not help depression and caused involuntary facial expressions even after stopping. permanent... raised sugar diabetic???	0
163850	i've been taking 15 mg for almost 3 weeks now for social anxiety and depression. the sleepy side effects wore off after maybe 3 days and now there are no side effects. i don't get the weight gain although i would agree with the late night hunger, and it helps me sleep. no sexual side effects which is great. as far as helping with my anxiety and depression i would say so far it's helped me enough. my expectations were too high. it has made me more awake and alive now and not worry as much as i used to when involved in social conversation with others.	1
132858	due to a recent endometriosis diagnosis my doctor switched me to lo loestrin from sronyx. the first day i took the pill i started cramping and bleeding like never before. i usually have really bad cramping, body aches, heavy bleeding but only for 3 days. it's now been 9 days on the pill and i am still bleeding heavily, cramping and having body aches. i don't understand and am so worried. i started the pill to control all these symptoms but its been very frustrating and confusing.	0
33460	the medication is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy, as long as you follow the guidelines of the medication. this is my 3rd month on the pill i have not gained weight or had any serious side effects. i do notice that i get cramps the week of my period but very minor. my period flow is a lot lighter. the only discomfort is breast enlargement and tenderness.	1
5725	it worked for the allergies but i can not sleep. i took it early yesterday morning around 7 it is 1:15 am now. i tried melatonin and a benadryl nothing! never never again!	0
231013	i didnt have a headache while taking savela (i could only take it for 5 days due to severe side effects), but savella didn't work for me. i experienced a rapid heart beat, chest pain, painful urination and stomach pain. i was only taking 50 mg/day. my heart beat went from mid 60's-70's to 105. my blood pressure was changing constantly.	0
12837	stops further outbreak, reduces inflammation, irritation and excessive &quot;shedding&quot;. causes all but the worst spots to go into complete remission.	1
99630	i wish i could give this prep a rating of 0. i am 21 and have to go for a colonoscopy. i work in the medical field and did not think i would have a hard time with the prep. not eating for the day didn't bother me at all, but after each sip of this prep, i gagged. i drank about 1/10 of the first cup (not exaggerating) and threw up 4x already. i now have a slight fever of 99, i am shaking and have the worst migraine. i will be cancelling my colonoscopy first thing in the morning and unfortunately i will have to either find a new prep or a new doctor. i would rather drink salt water off of a polluted beach than to ever drink this again. i wouldn't prescribe this prep to my worst enemy.	0
227718	i had implanon for just over 2 years. it was great because i never had to remember to take a pill, the insertion was quick, easy and hardly hurt at all. i bled for 4 months straight after getting it put in, but then after that i probably only had 4 or 5 more periods in the rest of the 2 years. that part of it was great. however, i got incredibly depressed and had to go on anti-depressants. i had insane mood swings, my personality changed, and i had basically no libido at all. to add to my low/non-existent libido, implanon made me really dry down there so sex hurt every single time. i just took it out yesterday. the removal process was pretty quick and generally painless, my arm is a little sore today, but not too bad.	0
161301	worst ever. mood swings. depressed. doesn't feel like i get enough sleep. i get angry then sad for no real reason. i am also noticing an increase in appetite, break outs, no energy. this is the most horrible bc because one is not going to be able to function to lead a normal life. i'm so disappointed that it has cause irregular bleeding.	0
226870	i know it protects me from having babies but the first month i was spotting every day. now in my fourth month its the same, spotting every single day. no change in my libido nor my hair is falling, nor have acne. i just hate that i'm bleeding even though my doctor said there might be none. i was expecting more out of this.	0
207520	attempted multiple times to submit a comment. interesting. i know medicine can be difficult. i underwent cancer treatment with the help of caring doctors. even the most difficult treatments can be humanely administered. this prep for a very basic procedure is much more difficult than it has to be. the taste is horrific- like drinking salt water. ridiculous.	0
108862	my biggest problem with this birth control is i have absolutely no sex drive. it really has gotten to the point where my husband thinks i don't love him. i try, but it's really awkward when you simply have no interest. it's due to be taken out in december and i'm praying that things turn around. this is obviously how the drug works, you can't get pregnant if you don't have sex!	0
21057	before my psychotic break that turned into a delusional police chase i was manic, terribly delusional, thought the devil was everywhere i went, thought people were after me, thought devil controlled electronics and the internet. just too many bad symptoms and after receiving invega injection i've been told that i was more outgoing, and had absolutely no symptoms. but the side effects sucks such as high prolactin levels which resulted in low testosterone, anhedonia, and lower emotions	1
232071	i take a 50 mg desyrel at night, about 10 min before i'm ready to go to sleep. i have been on it for 5 years, with no side effects. i used to not be able to stay asleep. now, i sleep like a baby. i also take zoloft in conjunction with trazodone.	1
221562	for the longest i have had a problem with breakouts on my face, mostly on my forehead and chin area. however, i must say this gel is the truth! i have been using it for 6 months now, and may have had one breakout in the beginning since i've been using it. i'm so glad i gave it a try, my skin looks great and i haven't had to deal with those sometimes painful acne breakouts.	1
231116	i am so upset that this new medicine did not work for me. i must have had an adverse/allergic reaction to it because i only took it for two days and i woke up with sore calf muscles, the worst stiff neck, really bad muscle pain, and a horrible sore throat. i did experience insomnia both nights as well. i called my doctor on the third day and was instructed to stop taking it right away. i thought this was going to be my miracle drug, i'm tired of all the different medicines and crazy side effects. i'm glad that it is working for others, hopefully i will find relief soon.	0
155257	i got extremely nauseous and that never happens to me , i can't make it stop . i stopped taking it a week ago and i still experience the pain. it makes me cry how sick i get sometimes . if you know anything to help please let me know . overall i don't recommend this drug at all !	0
47435	a friend gave me two 50 mg and said it was good pain pill, but i took both of them and it did nothing! what a waste!	0
21784	i love mucinex. i was at the store debating which expectorant to buy because i had so much phlegm in my nose and throat. by looking at the ingredients, mucinex has a higher dosage of expectorant and cough suppressant versus other brands. i needed something really strong! i took one tablet before i slept and then when i woke up in the morning, the phlegm was almost fully gone!! i was going the whole week without this and unable to breathe. will definitely take this the next time i get a cold. only downside is that it's costly compared to other brands... but you get what you pay for [:	1
55643	had been taking zoloft 50mg about a year, then when my life stress increased, it wasn't helping me cope well. im also taking generic adderal 10mg 2x daily which helps more with mood, focus, and anxiety. since generic effexor is working so well for my daughter, i had asked my psychiatrist if i could try it. from day one it seemed like a miracle and for about half a year i felt pretty normal. doc thought 75mg dose was too low, but once i went up in dose. i started the downward spiral of side effects. on day 3 now, taking zoloft 50mg again, per the doc, but feel horrible, physically and ever so crazy now and then. i'm older female and sure don't need this. wouldn't suggest this med to anyone over 30 because it's so nasty to change from.	0
165362	it was all going well until 6 months into it a sudden burst of laughter dislodged the mirena and it eventually perforated the uterus and ended up on the outside. after 2 lots of ultrasounds it has to be removed by laparoscopic surgery. not a good option if you live outside the city as many appointments to get it sorted plus the expense of it all.	0
97819	i've had this thing in my arm for a year and 4 months.. i bleed 3 weeks at a time, i may go a whole week without bleeding before i start up again. i am very hormonal and difficult to be around. i have always been fun and out going, i have turned into crab since i've been on this birthcontrol. last week i started passing clots and bleeding extra heavy, the cramps were out of this world. i literally could not move. i called my doctor to hear this is completely normal, and yes... after a year!! i told her i wanted it removed and now i have to be counselled on the matter. i do not recommend this to anyone...	0
121770	this medication gives you brain shivers if you are late taking your tablet.	0
223859	fewer side effects than depakote but nearly no benefit for migraines.	0
54887	i experienced problems with severe constipation when on the full dose (4 pills a day) and massive hair loss, especially in the shower. i did lose weight but the side effects were too severe and outweighed the benefits.	0
22605	i finished my 10 days dose of the medication, and nothing changed. i still have the stomach bloated and same old same old intestinal problems as before. not sure why my doctor gave it to me for 10 days, but it was useless.	0
28027	42 year old male. married with 2 kids. no drugs or alcohol. no history of anxiety or depression prior to this incident. several months ago i was wrongly diagnosed with throat cancer. as it turns out i am fine and cancer free. but the fear of leaving my family without a husband/father sent me into a tail spin filled with anxiety and depression. the worst part is that i stopped sleeping. my md put me on xanax (.5mg) and ambien (10mg) which only made things worse. finally went to shrink who put me on 10 mg lexapro that i take in the morning. the lex has given me the strength to get off the other 2 meds completely. after 1 month she bumped me up to 20 mg. after 6 weeks anxiety gone, depression gone, and i'm sleeping again naturally	1
89423	after trying prozac (didn't like) and wellbutrin (better than prozac but still not terrific), was given celexa by a new doc. i have dysthmia that increases in winter months (probably due to less light where i live, during the shorter days from oct-march). celexa gave me an almost instant 'happy' boost and i haven't been off it for more than 6 mos. for a long time. pros: more energy, no crying spells when daylight lessens during winter months. cons: did not work for my gad (i take alprazolam for that), libido is almost non-existent, and my emotions are somewhat blunted (meaning, i don't really cry often, when before i used to be emotional over a lot of things...but i can take that!) impact on libido is the most annoying side effect.	1
217822	i suffer from ptsd, anxiety and depression. i was given this medicine to help with focus. it reacted in my system as an 'old school' prescription diet pill and exacerbated my symptoms. reaction included the following symptoms over a period of 4 days: dry mouth, feeling dehydrated, crawling skin and scalp. moderate sinus and eye tension headaches, intense neck and shoulder tension. sleeping issues, very focused and specific brooding thoughts of death and dying, increased racing thoughts. blood pressure shifts, heart palpitations, easily confused and major short term memory disruption. extreme panic/anxiety attacks with 'shock' effects.	0
83558	my vision is so bad that i could not read the warnings on the box. i bought one bottle for home and one for work. big mistake. 1. it does not ease any of my allergy symptoms which include cough, runny nose and runny eyes. 2. it makes me feel stoned. 3. i've had pretty serious body aches since i started taking it. based on a few of the reviews here, i think it must be related. i am going to go cold turkey. it can't be worse than this stuff. does anything work for allergies? i will be moving to the desert soon. finger crossed!	0
151793	started smoking when i was 16 years old. since taking chantix for about 3 months i haven't smoked at all. the first week i cut down from a pack a day to maybe 7 a day. since then i have not smoked at all. chantix worked great for me. sometimes it makes me sick to my stomach after i take it. and i have had very weird vivid dreams. but i will take the side effects over smoking!	1
53907	i was prescribed a low dose of it for prevention if uti's and it gave me diarrhea..which for someone already dealing with ibs i'm on top of constant uti's...is not helpful at all. aside from that no side effects. still stopped taking it though and was prescribed methenamine... hope it works!	0
81320	my dermatologist recommended yaz for my acne. however i also have horrible menstrual cycles and let me tell you, you cannot go wrong with yaz. i hardly felt any pain. my acne was basically gone also. now all i have is some dark spots here and there	1
58131	i was recently put on norco 10/325 after being on vicodin since last summer. i had knee surgery which was not successful and now am living in constant pain. my doctor just increased my dosage from 4 to 6 a day. this should provide me with almost 100% relief from the pain. i wish i had an alternative to taking pain medicines. the medicine was scary at first (from the 5 mg vicodin) but i am now used to them and don't get that fuzzy feeling that made me so scared. now i know the drugs start to work because the pain goes away! norco does it's job well and i am grateful to have them.	1
206417	took for 9 months for maintenance of ulcerative colitis. i now have kidney damage. please make sure your doctor checks kidney function regularly while taking this.	0
48814	i wish i would have read these comments prior to me starting this pill. this has been the worst experience of my life!! i have been bleeding and passing extremely large blood clots for 13 days. it started 2 days into my second pack. the pain is severe almost mirroring labor pains with abdominal contractions everytime i pass a clot. i stopped the pill and bleeding continues to get worse. avoid this pill like the plague!!	0
183310	took about 3 weeks for this medicine to kick in before i noticed anything. when it did, the pain was intense for a couple of days but i stuck with it hoping things got better. they did! i was able to stand longer, walk longer, sit longer, and lay on my side all without intense pain. the pain was still there, but it made dealing with the pain more tolerable. i've been on this medicine for about 10 months now but dealing with this terrible pain for nearly 3 years. i've tried just about every medicine available and this medicine with elavil and oxycontin/oxycodone works like magic. i now use cymbalta with elavil and morphine and have had no issues.	1
161651	i'm a little young to be needing sleeping pills, but i do sadly. (17 years old). i took the 2 small tablets, and i fell asleep around an hour later. but when i woke up i felt like complete crap as i was so tired. i could barely get up to put my clothes on, and when i did, i felt a little dizzy, and i passed out which was the scariest thing. tried them again just in case it wasn't the pills, happened again. so for now i'm going to stick to taking 1 instead of 2, and see if that helps any.	0
77981	i was on the 0.1 cream started oct 2014 and ended early march.. i got it for whiteheads and uneven skin tone. after 4 1/2 months whiteheads diminished but left with even more scarring. we are going in to may and my skin hasn't healed. just ugly red chickenpox on my face. :( another con about this product i see that my skin texture isn't the same. when i was on it it was smooth but after i finished the tube it's just dull and my pores are huge. it just looks terrible and so much thinner, and my skin tone is still uneven it's depressing how much this cream has given me the uglies. it aged my skin 20 yrs. i'm only 23 and female btw. i don't know what to do now.	0
99028	after being off bc for 8 years i finally had to get back on, ive been on this bc for 2 months, no problems so far. i use to get severe cramps but since taking lutera its been all better. no weight gain, no mood swings or no loss of sleep either. my skin has cleared up a bit as well, i used to break out before my time off the month and now i dont. so far so good, everybody is different, what might not work for me, wont work for others.	1
170243	a word of caution. i've noticed how positive these reviews tend to be. you should look-up the withdrawal effects when coming of this drug. i've been on and off medication for the last 20 years. when i came of efexor 15 years ago i couldn't walk for three days. but that was nothing compared to seroquel. and it takes 90 days for the withdrawal effects to begin to wear off. seriously, before taking this drug you need to do some research. i would strongly advise you to find another drug.	0
202489	for some, lithium is the most effective choice for bipolar mania. unfortunately for me, it's not. my body rebelled against it immediately and without pause for its entire 60-day 'trial'. my bowels were never solid the entire time. i'm amazed now that i never recognized any dehydration symptoms over that time. it worked for my dear departed mother, but not for me, but i gave it a shot.	0
108524	this drug has been far better at treating my add than any other drug. i have tried phentermine, aderall, ritalin, and straterra for my inability to focus. all other drug under the amphetamine category have caused extreme anxiety and ,when they wear off, horrible depression and negative thoughts. evekeo has caused a minimum of these side effects and has increased my ability to focus. when the drug wears off, i feel like i go back to my normal state without all of the depression and negative thoughts. i don't want to describe it like this, but when it wears off it is a very &quot;smooth&quot; come down. i also like that it isn't extended release because other medications would last up to 16 hours, disrupting my sleep.	1
47484	i got nucynta after i had surgery on my hand. i severed tendons and the recovery was awful. i was given norco and then also nucynta. the 2nd night i took the nucynta i started to feel strange. my heart was racing and i felt panicky. my bf asked me if i was okay and i couldn't answer him. i stared at him because i was trying to not have a panic attack. the feeling i felt is hard to explain. i just knew something was wrong and i was having some kind of reaction. finally i asked him to take me to hospital. once on the freeway i had a hallucination. i saw a 20 ft tall figure on the side of the road. i swear on my life. no other drugs were involved.. i don't drink and have never had this happen before. i was okay a few hrs later but it was scary!	0
126114	i've tried lots of different medicines for depression. i've been on wellbutrin for about 6 years with success, added effexor for anxiety; had a good few years. then i went down hill, and have been trying many others since to find a good combination for me. i tried a few others without any good results, my psychiatrist had me try viibryd. i felt a bit better for a few weeks at first, now i'm not sure it's doing anything at all. i upped my wellbutrin again and that made a little difference with my energy, but i'm still just sad and depressed at all times. now i have to try other medicines! nice to know it worked for some.	0
84987	3 weeks into taking this birth control i experienced severe anxiety, debilitating panic attacks that sent me to urgent care and kept me from working, depression, sensitivity to light and sound, racing heart, insomnia, and a complete personality change for the worse. my family didn't want to be around me. i stopped taking this drug 4 days ago and already feel a tremendous difference. i no longer have anxiety about going to bed at night, or driving on fast roads, or anything else that used to shut me down before. i have noticed a difference in my outlook on life, my personality, and it's only been 4 days. my doctor told me it can take a week to get completely out of my system but i am seeing improvement everyday. consumers beware of this drug.	0

122633	unlike most people who post on here beware my experience with this drug has been horrific. after taking as directed by manufacturer, one hour before first meal, i almost instantly become deathly ill. cramping and spasms so severe i can hardly breath and feel like i am going into shock. this last for two hours. i couldn't call 911 if i tried. i can't move i'm so sick. after the episode i can barely walk i'm so weak. my chest hurts terribly for hours afterward. i've been so desperate to have a bowel movement that i have tried this drug several times with same result. never again! i do eventually have severe diarrhea toward the end of the episode. this drug is not for me.	0
175962	experienced hives and shaking after three days. i had to go to the er and they told me if i ever take it again it could kill me. interestingly, my mother is also allergic to levaquin.	0
40035	i have been on this medication since 3/12/15, i've lost 25 pounds. i am on a lower carb (only fruits and veggies- no grains). i feel great. i've stopped binge eating. you can't have high fat foods on this medication or you will get sick. stick with lean protein and fruits and vegetables. i've stopped craving snack foods or fast foods. i walk 4 miles a day. this isn't a magic pill. you still have to put in the work. i do have trouble with constipation, so i upped my water intake to ten glasses a day and miralax once a day. i'm sleeping better. the first two months, i slept awful. it could have been sugar withdrawal.	1
196021	stendra is the best! fast acting, reliable and works great. stendra works! my sex life has never ever been better. thank you, stendra!	1
178512	the pain is gone. it took around 3 1/2 weeks to 'kick in' fully. most days are great. i can work again. i can play with my kids again. i'm living again. cymbalta worked for my fibromyalgia pain when nothing else would.	1
146356	almost everything i find about this medication is tied to addiction. however, my case is quite different. i am a severe chronic pain patient. i have tried fentanyl, lortab, morphine, tramadol, and a few others to try to get my pain to be managed. nothing worked until i gave up on opiates helping me, and detoxed off them. while detoxing, i realized that yucky orange pill that supposed to be helping my withdrawals (which i never had) was working awesome on my pain. i went through the detox thinking the opiates were causing the pain. about 24 hours after leaving the hospital, and my last suboxone dose, the pain came back hard. i then started back on the suboxone, and i have my life back. for me this little pill is a miracle!	1
26898	i started this new tresiba, was the first person in the state to start it. right afterwards, when i did the switch from levemir to tresiba, i caught the worst cold known in the history of man, and i mean bad too, i was so tired, and at night i coughed so bad, i'd lose my breath. doctor told me i don't have a cold, as my lungs were crystal clear. no matter what i did i could not get rid of this cold, and it got worse by the day. i began to become suspicious when no one and i mean not a one around me caught this miserable cold. i put 2 and 2 together, and i said it must be tresiba. went back on levemir, and the cold was gone in 48 hours. no pharmacy knew about this or adverse effects, it was that new. never again.	0
102684	after having to pay a but load out of pocket for this i slowly found out it was not for me. it put me in a hyper-manic state. had to constantly be moving. would wake up every morning at 7 am, when the sunlight started peaking in my room, regardless of what time i was finally able to pass out. and worst of all, it caused me to have problems using the restroom. no matter how hard i tried or what i did it made me not able to urinate. some meds don't work on some people as they should.	0
188274	i have had 2 paraguard iuds. took the 1st one out to get pregnant, got the 2nd after my daughter was born. both times, i had heavier periods, but it seemed better than hormonal birth control that makes me crazy. after 2 and a half years, i started having strange side effects. lots of acne, dry skin, swollen lymph node, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, hopelessness. my doctor said that my swollen lymph node is associated with the liver. my acupuncturist said she thought i had liver congestion. i researched excess copper in the body. all. my. symptoms. had it removed within 2 days. felt immediately better. my acne started healing within a few days. not feeling depressed anymore. it was great until it wasn't.	0
128125	started taking phentermine on mar.23, 2016 and as of dr appt. today may 18, 2016, i am down 27.6 lbs. i started out at 232.8 and am at 205.2. i'm 5'5&quot; and i'm 46. my blood pressure is coming back down, and i have tons of energy. i realized if i take it about 10am, i still sleep at night!	1
203960	took ambien with no problems. doctor wanted me to come off ambien and try belsomra. he gave me samples. took a 10mg dose and it didn't help me fall asleep or stay asleep. up all night. then- the weird nightmares. i had hours of vivid nightmarish dreams. not good. woke up exhausted. why would anyone take this medication if it's going to give you nightmares? i'm already an insomniac. i don't need nightmares and hallucinations too. going back to ambien.	0
178300	i have been on cymbalta for one month for relentless anxiety and depression, after trying paxil, wellbutrin, prozac and many others i can not even remember the names of. there has been a loss of appetite for a few weeks but it has mostly gone away. it caused panic in the beginning but ativan helped a little with that. after a week i felt really good(20 mg) and have been up and down ever since. it has helped a lot but so far it is not the answer.	0
160773	at first it worked pretty well but about 3 months later i was having the anxiety again.	0
216067	i've had mine in for 4 months and i am getting it removed next month. i'm really bummed this didn't work for me as i have tried many of the hormonal types of birth control and discontinued because i always endured terrible side effects. i decided to discontinue this because the cramping i have is becoming unbearable. i have cramping 3 out of 4 weeks and i have to take 4x 800mg ibuprofen. before i had my period for 3-4 days and would have bad cramping for one day that could be fixed by taking 1-2 500mg tylnenol tablets.	0
58272	ciprodex was prescribed by my ent doctor in portland oregon in january 2008. immediately after using this drug i developed serious vertigo issues that resulted in a fall. i also got tinnitus, ringing in the ears which is especially annoying.	0
64741	i've been on an effective dose (100mg or higher) for over half a year and i haven't seen any effects. my doctor first had me on lexapro, which made me nauseous, so we decided to switch to zoloft. when i first started zoloft, it gave me headaches for the first week or so, but aside from that i experienced no negative side effects. unfortunately, i haven't experienced any positive effects either. i'm on zoloft for social anxiety and mild to moderate depression. the only other effect i've noticed is more vivid dreams. so while i'm glad that zoloft had very minimal side-effects (headaches), this just didn't work for me. i was on 100mg a day for about two months, then 150, and finally 200. i saw no change/improvement in anxiety or depression.	0
125414	i took the tablet as i had been constipated for around 2 weeks!!! just over 2 hours since i had taken the tablet i felt very weak and sick, i felt as if i was about to throw up. then the cramps started, they were horrific. worse than anything i had ever felt before. it was as if i was getting punched from the inside (100x worse than any period pains i've experienced) and it lasted about an hour!!!! they did in the end relieve my constipation and the pains did stop but i will never take these tablets ever again, it was not worth going through all the pain.	0
48920	i have been using aviane for months. this is my first birth control and it has put my hormones back on track. before using aviane i cramped up to a week before starting and 7-10 day long periods. i was also extremely moody before on the pill. now my periods are 3-4 days long, my cramping no longer requires pain meds, and i'm no longer moody. the only side effect i have is a low sex drive.	1
158177	i have been taking geodon for about 10 months now and unfortunately it has given me erectile dysfunction. i started to reduce the dosage in order to stop but not taking it affects my mood tremendously. without it i feel hopeless, i cry a lot and it is difficult for me to get out of bed. however, i can't risk it affecting my sexual well-being (i sincerely hope it's not too late!) so i guess geodon did not help me and my bipolar disorder.	0
142095	i have been on and off of antidepressants my whole life. i have been on lexapro for a year and it helped tons. i don't feel depressed anymore but it seems that i don't have a range of emotions. i always seem somewhat subdued, not able to cry, don't get very excited about anything. i have trouble falling asleep and actually getting good sleep. i guess because of that i am often tired during the day. the sexual side effects are irritating. i gained a little weight but i also quit smoking so that may have had a part in the weight gain. on a positive note, i am not so overwhelmed with worrying. i can concentrate much better at school. my irritability has lessened. i feel sane again.	1
12042	i have been on skelaxin since 1994 and it is the only medication that has worked for me all these years. i was in a bad car wreck in '94 and then i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. when i had back surgery in '07 and i was without it for 3 months, i thought i would die. my surgeon put me back on it and when he did, i started feeling better. it is a great medication for me.	1
189214	on june 7, 2016 my pain management doctor put me on 5 mg oxycodone, twice a day with 15 mg of ms contin at bedtime. so far the oxy seems to be helping me with my chronic back pain but does not last long. when i see him again in 4 weeks i am going to ask for a higher dose or to take a couple more per day. i'm a newbie at the clinic where he is at now and i think he is just trying to see what works and what doesn't since i haven't seen him in about 3 years. the downfalls for this med is i sometimes get itchy and the risk of addiction.	1

56330	i have been on humira since january and my pain is worse, especially in my upper extremities. i was told at the time i started humira that my thyroid levels were too low (hashimoto disease). the doctor upped thyroid meds at that time i am wondering if perhaps that is playing a roll in my ra not improving. it is hard to be patient when in pain.	0
43928	i have been taking diabetic medications like byetta, victoza, bydureon, and trulicity for at least the last 10 years. these medications slow down your digestive process. i have had chronic constipation since i started them. peg is truly a miracle, no joke. i went from having to force myself to go every 3 or 4 days. which was miserable. to being regular. i take 1 cap full once a day and i go at least once a day without struggle. i will continue this product. like one person earlier said. &quot;if you have never experienced this situation, you really have no idea what is is like to go from chronic constipation to being regular again.	1

198779	worst birth control i've ever been on. even compared to needing my mirena iud surgically removed. all birth control comes with side effects but i had the worst experience with the depo shot. i stayed on it just over a year and a half (thinking it would get better eventually?) and i decided not to continue it, with all the issues i've had. zero sex drive, extreme fatigue, lots of weight gain, major anxiety (needed medication), moodiness.. now that i stopped, i'm having major abdominal cramping, similar to mild contractions. i would not recommend this birth control. i feel like i've become a completely different person with all these mood changes and fatigue. i hope i can get back to normal after this. really regretting doing the depo..	0
212341	i found this medication very good for my bipolar depressive episodes. no side effects, and as i take it continuously it helps prevent recurrences of my down cycle.	1
145322	i had the implanon inserted over a year ago. i gained 8kgs in less than 6 months,i always had the perfect skin but the implanon causes me to have spots everyday. i have irregular bleeding sometimes 2 - 3 weeks at a time and i am heavily bloated all the time. i am very emotional and sometimes just get angry over nothing. i get bad back pains and pains in my legs . i have been heavily dieting for the past 3 months even using duromine to help me,which makes me feel worse.i have lost only 2.8kgs in 3 weeks. the implanon is definitely effective and i really don't want to fall pregnant. i suffer from severe anxiety and i am afraid the anxiety will get worse if i remove it. i suffered for at least 4 months to overcome some of the anxiety symptoms	0
154515	i have recently reviewed the side effects associated with this medication and have found i have experienced quite a few of them. to my dismay, and my overall naiveness, these have contributed to some of the most uncomfortable and embarrassing situations. first and foremost, i had to have cataracts removed from both eyes just two years ago. then there are the two bouts of pneumonia, the most recent was double pneumonia. weight gain nearly impossible to control, swelling of feet and lower legs is becoming far too frequent these days, numbness in the extremities, rashes have been getting even worse than they have been in a while, suffered through shingles, eczema, and other strange and sundry skin maladies. i've been on it too long, obviously.	0
154619	i will try to summarize my experience. went to the hospital for stomach pains. was given this in an iv and a prescription to take home. next day, started having chest pain and back pain. that evening as i was falling asleep i experienced tightness in my chest and a difficulty trying to breathe with numbness in my lower face/neck and hands. i went to the er again not sure if it was heart problems or a panic attack (which i&rsquo;ve never had). er said everything looked fine, but i was still having difficulty breathing and numbness even though i had calmed myself down. it is the day after and i still have numbness and heavy breathing but it has improved and i hope in another day or two i will be back to feeling like myself. i won&rsquo;t take this antibiotic again	0
122689	i tried everything. diet, exercise, teas, fiber supplements, miralax, amitiza (rx). this is the only one that has worked immediately and effectively. i am out of commission for two hrs after taking which has to be on an empty stomach so i'm only taking on weekends now. no headaches, nausea, or other i'll effects like when i took amitiza or miralax. hope this keeps working long term	1

65496	i've been on yasmin for about a year now. i was on ortho-tri for a few years prior to that, and nordette (another birth control pill) a few years prior to that one. because i've been on a pill for so long, my body didn't need much adjusting to yasmin, nor did i notice any huge side effects. although, after reading some reviews, i have noticed that i feel more sensitive emotionally now since being on yasmin, i don't feel like i get mood swings per say where i'm mad, more like its easier for me to cry for something i normally wouldn't have cried so easily before. also, i've noticed more frequent migraine headaches, and my hair is thinner but despite this, i think its still the best one for me out there. they all have pros, cons, and risks!	1

215168	well i started this medicine on monday and its thursday and i am extremely sick. my stomach is killing me i sit on the toilet because i feel like i am going to go to the bathroom but nothing ever comes out. i have severe abdominal cramping and cold chills that make it even worse. my chest feels tight and i am so uncomfortable and grouchy because of the pain. this is awful i would not recommend because i was so excited about being able to go to the bathroom and be normal but this has not worked. i am not taking any more of this medication when it is suppose to help with chronic idiopathic constipation and ibs and its made it worse!! so upset i could scream...	0
129125	hey ladies, i told myself i would share my experience if i found out i wasn't pregnant.. so here i am. i had sex during one of my most fertile days (october 6-8). i was not on any birth control (was sick for a while so i went off it). him and i were in the heat of the moment and ended up not using a condom. though we used the pull out method i still knew about pre cum and it scared the hell out of me. this happened around midnight and none of the drugstores were open. right when the store opened (9am) i headed over and swallowed down the plan b. i got every symptom from the pill for a constant dreadful two weeks and could not sleep due to extreme stress. i'll take pain over being pregnant any day, so thank you plan b.	1
143924	i got the match stick implant inserted 10/13/14 and now it's 8/14/16 , and as far as pregnancy it's amazing with keeping under control , you can you use protection or not and never worry about pregnancy ( but i suggest using protection) but i have never had bad anxiety before but recently it's been crippling and i have no idea why and in heading it's because of this birth control. i have long irregular periods , irregular color from my normal period before. i notice more discharge and more mood swings and it's crazy. i feel crazy sometimes. i lost 25 pounds within a year tho, i weighed 125-130 last october and now i weigh 104, from stress. you have to have a strong mind to be able to deal with birth controls head games!	1
94466	it's good i think i might need it again ?. .	0
99642	it is hard to describe the taste. sort of like a concoction of sweetart, cherry flavor, salty taste with a hint of sweetness all mixed together. i have had worse tasting meds. it took about 5 minutes to drink it and then i started on the first 16oz. bottle of water. i felt very full and for me walking around the house helped. i belched a few times and within 15 min. i had to go to the bathroom and then about every 5 min. for the next 30 min. or so. after that it started slowing down and i didn't have to go as much. i'm almost totally clear after the 1st round. i recommend baby wipes and vaseline to keep from chaffing also brush your teeth and rinse to get rid of the after taste. it really helps.	1
196183	i have been taking generic brand of luvox just over 14 years now. it seemed to work for the first few years but it would only reduce the intrusive thoughts and anxiety where you could manage throughout the day. i just switched to luvox brand name a couple of days ago. i just got my life back. i practically feel cured. i am more mentally focused, my concentration is much better, and most importantly my intrusive unwanted thoughts area pretty much gone. i feel like i can carry the world on my shoulders. luvox brand name has changed my life forever. i hope it continues to do so for the years to come. i thank god for giving me the idea to try and switch from generic to brand !!!!!!!!	1
198911	i had the shot march 20th 2016. i had 2 weeks before the bleeding started. at first it was spotting, but every day. then it was heavier bleeding. then it got so heavy i was changing an ultra tampon every 45m to 2h, even at night. i was at my doctors exhausted from lack of sleep, crying, anemic, with hormonal acne, horrible back pain from constant period pain, and terrible mood swings. i only had the 1 shot. i refused any more. it's currently august and i am still bleeding. there is no sign of it ending!!! i would not have this shot again, even if they paid me!!!	0
194940	i took the regular keppra and it made me feel groggy and tired. since taking the keppra xr i feel more normal and balanced.	1
26301	worse birth control, i have been taking it for 2 weeks and i am already experiencing horrid headaches, i'm nauseous and i feel like i have something just sitting in my stomach. but the worst part, i have a decreased sex drive and when i have sex i dry up very quick which is so frustrating that i can't even enjoy my sex life while being on this pill.	0
3204	after 4 days out of 7, twice a day, i quit taking it for two days and then resumed once a day. i had developed severe lethargy and dizziness and red splotches on my hands. weakness disappeared within a day but then returned when i resumed. there must be an alternative out there.	0
227331	i got the nexplanon put in sometime last may. after 2 kids and 24 years this was my first birth control, i figured it would be most convenient because i am horrible with taking pills. for the first 2 weeks it was fine but then after that i bled for 90 days straight. i didn't feel any side affects until after that 90 days. i started feeling anxious all the time and i don't want to get out of bed some days or even do any of my normal daily activities. i have been married for 5 years and having sex with my husband was never a &quot;duty&quot; but on this birth control i am never up to it it's horrible. although not having a period ever now is nice having all the other side affects are not worth it so i am having this implant removed next week.	0
118572	i'm on my fourth day of using the prevpac for h. pylori infection which was discovered during a medical procedure (colonoscopy and endoscopy). i was experiencing stomach discomfort (throbbing alternating aches from left to right) which prompted me to have these procedures. day one: i felt tired and experienced severe stomach pain including bloating, but it (stomach pain) eventually subsided. day two: minor stomach pain and little bloating. day three: i did not experience any pain but i had the metallic taste and felt fatigued. i have noticed that my bowels are larger (sorry for the extra information) than normal. details to take into consideration: female and a minority	1
101703	did not react to this well. had a concussion and occipital neuralgia diagnosis after a car accident and was prescribed this. i do not take meds well so not surprised that this wasn't good for me. i had an immediate reaction of extreme shivering and body shaking that i had to deal with until the meds faded. did not reduce head tension or pain and just made me really scared by my bodies reaction. i never took another.	0
185312	a few of my friends and i who are on it (we work in a hospital and all started taking it) plateaued at 25-27 lbs. so, a couple of us stopped taking it, maintained what we lost, and are going to start it again. the reason is that the longer we were on it, the less we felt that &quot;i'm hungry but nothing sounds good&quot; feeling that curbed our appetites. will go back on soon. i went from 314 lbs to 288 lbs - maintaining about 291.	1
61511	gave these a try to help with anxiety and depression, had lots of side affects i'm on 10 mg a day. i won't be taking more. i have had headache's sleepiness, upset stomach and my anxiety has got worse. i took them for over two weeks now but can't deal with side effects anymore.	0
142484	getting the skyla inserted was not painful at all. it was just uncomfortable and there was a lot of cramping and pressure but it was over in five minutes. after, i experienced very minor cramping and bleeding. overall, it was a great experience and i would recommend to anyone who is considering this type of birth control!	1
84127	i was on this birth control to actually get pregnant because my periods are so irregular...i've literally gone 9 months without a period so as you can see no periods no babies...this birth control is horrible i've only been on it for 3 weeks now. i've had terrible mood swings acne break outs terrible cramping to the point of going to the hospital thinking something was wrong with me. felt very nauseous and light headed and bad headaches. by the 3rd week i had clumps of hair coming out in the shower...i've never had any of these issues before. the only good i can give this is the fact that it made my period light and actually come on time.	0
67864	i told myself if it worked i was going to write a review, because i know how scared i was and i came here for comfort. i had unprotected sex with a guy i wasn't even dating, around the beginning of july. i took the pill less than 12 hours after the incident happened. a week after i took the pill, i got a period for around 5 days, heavy, brown, but with no cramps. it described implant bleeding almost to closely, so i grew even more scared!!! i had slight breast tenderness around the time aswell but nothing other than that. i just got my period yesterday, almost a full month after i missed my original period date. don't freak out if your period is more than a week late, mine was nearing 4 weeks late before it finally came. stay hopeful! ❤️	1

33520	started this pill exactly a month ago and the first week was terrible. felt nauseous about 6 hours after taking the pill, which made me very weak and sick feeling. had to call out of work twice and leave early because i would throw up. my second week got a lot better started taking it around 8 pm and would sleep through the side effects. still taking it today and feel a lot better.	1
181825	i'm 21 years old and have unfortunately inherited my family's notorious migraine genes. i've suffered from migraines from a very young age. the 1st medicine i was given at age 21 being finally officially diagnosed by military doctors, while being deployed to iraq, was zomig dissolving tablets. no luck, second was imitrex tablets - same thing, nothing except side effects. then i was tried on stat-dose imitrex, still nothing. the only thing that's helped with killing my migraines is an er visit being treated with fluids, valium to knock me out and dilaudid or morphine along with phenergran.	0

119031	i'm a 21 year old full-time college student dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety. after a severe panic attack, my doctor prescribed me with zoloft to help quell my anxiety. he started me on a low dosage (50mg) and it helped out a little. then 2 weeks later he doubled my dosage. this caused me to hit an all-time low. i've never been depressed in my life, until zoloft. it caused me to be miserable, anti-social and alienate myself from the world. everyone's body reacts differently to medications, but if you feel like zoloft's making you depressed stop taking it. it can be a nightmare if you don't react well to it! after 3 days off zoloft i felt exponentially better.	0
151093	i suffer from degenerative arthritis in my lower spine, which is slowly making its way up my back. at first i was taking oxynorm which is the same as oxycontin but in an instant release form. i began on 10mg a day, however due to tolerance issues this dosage quickly increased. leaving me in a state where i was so stoned i might as well have been drunk. concerned with that i spoke to my gp who changed me over to oxycontin, slow release. after 3 years, due once again to tolerance i am on 80mg 3x24hrs. the pain relief is awesome sometimes it's so effective i forget my backs stuffed. however some of the side effects are bad for instance i forget to breath, have trouble swallowing and the constipation is horrendous.	1
211303	started this drug ten days ago for oab syndrome . now have urine retention grrr	0
161286	i love this birth control. cleared up my acne, no mood swings, no weight gain, and light periods that happened like clock work!	1
207406	did not taste nearly as bad as anticipated; used a straw to get it far back in mouth and drank it pretty quickly. very minor nausea for about 10-15 minutes, started working in about 20-30 minutes, was able to leave bathroom after about an hour and a half then maybe one more trip. no cramping, etc. much easier than i had heard it would be.	1
103244	used to treat chronic pain (idiopathic origin, but could be fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue). ease of use was fine, only side effects were stomach upset.	0
365	i got my first dose feb. 24th. i cramped for about 3 weeks. i started to spot around march 20. i've been bleeding heavy on and off since march 22 to present. its horrible. i have serious mood swings. my face has broken out badly. and i'm always tired and constantly eating. my body feels weak maybe due to lose of to much blood. i won't be getting my second dose in may!	0
196471	the only problem, besides the aftertaste, is that i find i need to go to bed within 10 minutes of taking the medicine or the sleepy effect just doesn't happen and i'm left tossing and turning the rest of the night.	1
69498	i've been on the suboxone program for over 13 years. i am now weening once again but have had nothing but complete success on this medication. i would recommend it for anyone addicted to heroin or methadone or any opiate for that matter. a huge thumbs up!	1
126353	i was put on coreg 25 mg 2 daily after a heart stent. day by day i felt worse. i was very short of breath and my abdomin starting bloating and felt a lot of pressure in my abdomin especially about 4 hours after taking the coreg. called the cardiologist told them my concerns and told them i thought it was my meds, they said no that it was not the meds to call my pcp. the symptoms got so severe i ended up in the er and after a ct scan and blood work i was told it was the coreg making me feel this way. just a horrible med for me. doctors need to listen to their patients.	0
143984	i got mines inserted in february 2016. i was excited about the weight gain since i'm slim and had lost a few pounds but my weight is stable. no acne breakouts, mood swings, best of all no periods!! after insertion my period left and about 3 months later i spotted for 3 days and nothing since. no nausea like the pills, no vaginal wetness like the ring, no aches in bones like depo... i love it! sorry for those dealing with bad experiences.	1
174921	this never worked for me, not even a little. it might have been a placebo. testin works great!!!	0
68742	i had my first shot of depo 5 weeks after i had my second baby. i am breastfeeding so my options were the depo shot or the progesterone only pill (which the dr said is not as effective). at the time of my first shot i was cleared to workout so i immediately went back to my workout routine. 4 months after my first baby i was 10 lbs under pre-baby weight and by the time she was 6 months old i had gained some muscle back and looked and felt like myself again. i weighed 175 lbs at my first shot of depo when my baby was 5 weeks old and i'm now 170 and she is 5 months old. i didn't gain weight, but it basically stopped my weight loss. if you are at all concerned about weight loss do not take this drug!! i just want it out of my system for good.	0
162457	when i have a cold that blocks sinuses, ears, and chest - this is what i take.	1
187993	i just started on the powder form of this medication. the first night i gagged on it, but managed to drink it down at around 3pm. i felt so much nausea that i wasn't sure i wanted to continue, but the next day i felt no urgency, had a normal bowel movement and felt no nausea. i slammed down the whole drink and didn't gag the following few nights. i'm so glad i didn't give up and continued to take cholestryam.	1
105896	i had such high hopes for strattera, but it was completely ineffective and actually made my condition worse. i wanted it to help me focus on work: sending emails, making phone calls, generally being able to work at a computer and other things. i started at 40mg a day, and found myself slightly more tired. i raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. finally i went to 80mg and still no help with focus. i just found that i was lethargic, unmotivated and tired. i took naps and lazed around, but didn't get as excited about things as i had before the medicine. my job requires creativity, and it's hard to be creative if you're not excited about it. so i actually became less productive.	0
163956	poor! obviously a male must've been the person the person behind the making of these tablets because they are poor! too mild. when a woman takes painkillers for menstrual pains, it means they don't want to feel anything! but these tabs don't eradicate the pain like other regular pains do. in face, nurofen plus is far much better than the one for menstrual pains. i just think this was another way to expand their product line in the market to increase their customer base and profits! nurofen guys, relook at it please!	0
208995	was on ambien and doing well and the doctor told me since i was over 65 i could not have it any longer. tried trazadone, rozarem and then belsomra. i got maybe 2-3 hours sleep on the belsomra if that and the dreams were axe murderer vivid. i also developed leg weakness and found my insurance copay was over $100.00! i finally am back on my ambien and am sleeping my usual 8 hours with no hangover in the morning and no axe murderer dreams. am very disappointed in belsomra as i had watched its' development for awhile and had high hopes.	0
56069	product worked for me but the packaging is terrible, i had similar experience to the other reviewers. the individual doses will tear apart like the perforation indicates. then the pill on the end of the applicator falls out wherever - in the package, on the floor, in the sink, etc. my insurance will not cover so the cost is $30-40 a pill. this is like gold so i can't just throw the contaminated pill away. how yucky to have to insert a pill into my body that can't be sterile anymore. i don't care if the cost if higher, i am back to vagifem.	1
148230	so i have been taking lyza for 5 months now. if i am 1hour or more late on taking my pill then i will automatically start a bleeding cycle for 5 days at least. i have no clue when my period actually is anymore. i also have had a 15 pound weight gain. i have also been losing hair, been depressed, and other odd things. i do not like this birth control at all, does not work well with my body.	0
131615	before anyone agrees to taking effexor (venlafaxine), please look at the withdrawl symptoms. the symptoms and experience has been likened to heroin or opiate addiction withdrawl. please do your research and regardless of what your doctor tells you, there are alternatives! i hope this helps someone.	0
192903	count me as another woman upset that ocella is no longer a generic. according to bluecross, who has received tons of calls on this change, ocella is now a brand name drug and is also non-formulary. even though the drug worked great for me and was helpful in my treatment of pcos, there's no way i can spend $160 for a three month supply, especially for something that used to be completely covered by insurance.	1
142921	i've had this form of bc 4 years now. about one year after using this product i started having mood swings feeling so weak and tired,but never thought about my nexplanon having to be the blame! making an appointment next week to have it removed!! i use to never take a nap after work now just about everyday i feel awful if i don't lay day to nap i fell sick to the stomach..i really want to feel like myself again..i would not recommend this bc	0
199111	i received the shot 20 days ago and have been bleeding every day since! my doctor gave me pills after me having my period for 2 weeks and said it would stop my period. all that did was make it lighter. i am supposed to take the pills for 10 days. so far it has been 9 and i am still bleeding. i will not get this again! i only got it because of the nausea i would get from the pills i was on before and my heavy periods and bad cramps. but this is not worth it!	0
48648	after the 1 month, i started to have headaches, i've always have cysts and as a consequence, acne. it got worse! terrible! and i started to have hair everywhere! it's horrible! dr said it was going to get better after the 3 months, it's been 6 and it's just worse everyday. i'm definitely changing.	0
100456	this is the worst birth control experience i've ever had. i was on quasense for three years, but stopped when breakthrough started to occur. i am on these medications for birth control, but also to manage excessively heavy and painful periods. i started apri on the first day of my period. i then bled for 12 days, followed by five days of horrible discharge. i stopped apri 12 days into the pack after experiencing ridiculous weight gain (my diet did not change.) headaches, outrageous mood swings, anxiety, full body pain, cramping, muscle spasms in my neck and severe fatigue. it is now day 18, (five days off the pill) and i'm still bleeding and dealing with tremendous mood swings. i have gained what looks like 20 or so pounds.	0
88159	dr gave me this prescription for a tooth that was abscessed. the swelling had intensified after taking a hot shower which made it look like i had a softball in my jaw. the pain from it was utterly unimaginable and i was popping vicodin and tylenol 3s like skittles. i did hear this particular antibiotic is linked to causing a specific disease in the colon because antibiotics do not discriminate when it comes to bacteria. good or bad it has to go. however, after taking my first dose of this and a ibuprofen, the pain literally disappeared within 30 minutes. it was amazing. i cried, then went to sleep. no terrible side effects other than soft stool.	1
166513	i had the mirena iud for 1 yr 4 mo. the insertion pain wasn't too bad, but starting immediately after insertion, i had stabbing knife like pain in my lower right side which brought me back to my gynecologist one month later in tears. i was told that the mirena iud was not responsible for the pain, and ultrasound confirmed it looked normal. i suffered from chronic pain leading to nsaid induced ulcers, complete loss of libido, breakthrough bleeding 20+ days per month, &amp; depression. i was prescribed additional medications and was scheduled for exploratory surgery. one month ago, i had it removed, and was reproachfully told it wasn't going to help. since then, i've had no pain and no bleeding. mirena did not work for me.	0
229253	after using viagra 50mg successfully for 8 years i gave the everyday 10mg cialis a try. during the free 30 day trial it was great. but since then (i'm paying for it now) the results have been eratic. it's good for a week or two, and then nothing! very frustrating (and expensive) to have to take viagra as well. i'm going back to viagra even though it is less convenient.	0
123071	i have been on this pill for a year now and i noticed my skin is getting progressively worse. i never had bad skin before and now even on proactive it's bad! i also have very dry eyes from the pill. my doctor even put punctual plugs in my tear ducts and my eyes are still dry. i also noticed that it makes me sweat a lot more than i normally do.	1
118348	i made the mistake taking one vicodin two days prior to starting naltrexone and had the worst withdrawals. mental cravings stronger than ever.	0
15458	i was recently switched from gildess to microgestin, &amp; microgestin was awesome! very few side effects, &amp; my cycle became regular, &amp; cramps mild. i went to fill my prescription last month &amp; was blindsided by this new brand blisovi 1/20. the pharmacist stated it's the same formula as microgestin. yeah right! since starting this b/c i've experienced intense headaches/severe sinus problems, vision problems, anxiety, sleep issues, bloating, sore/swollen hands &amp; joints, very tender breasts, &amp; feeling so lethergic. i was actually starting to wonder if it even prevented pregnancy due to the symptoms. i thought it was just the holidays. just finished the first pack &amp; will never take it again! do not recommend this pill!!	0
90329	within 4 hours my eyes ..lips were swelling ...headache....agitation...aches in joints which i never have....fatigue .....	0
196372	three nights in a row, with no benefit whatsoever. it's as if i'd taken a placebo -- laid in bed for over two hours with no drowsiness at all. by the third night, i was angry and anxiety-filled (not sure if it was a side effect or if i was just fed up with trying something that didn't work).	0
86447	starting taking invokana 100mg along with my 1000mg metformin on 4-2-16. by 4-12-16 i had the worst yeast infection i'd ever had. did the treatment for 3 days, didn't ever really feel regular. now today i have another yeast infection. in everyone's experience, does this side effect go away after a certain amount of time on the medication, or keep coming back all the time? my doctor's promises of this assisting with weight loss and severe edema in my ankles and feet have not come to fruition either. i am only willing to continue to suffer if i know that this ends after a month or so on the meds.	0
101515	loving vaniqa so far! some details on my facial hair situation. i don't have pcos, yet have severe facial hair issues (full beard if i let it go, especially around chin and on neck). spent thousands of dollars on laser hair removal, and as soon as i stopped getting the laser treatments, the hair all came back, worse than before. using nair or veet only worked for the soft hair on my cheeks, irritated my skin horribly, and didn't do anything for the prickly chin and neck hair. i've never been brave enough to shave (except my mustache area), for fear of even worse beard-effect. waxing didn't touch the problem. vaniqa, after about 4 weeks of faithful twice a day use, has significantly slowed the growth. now pluck a few minutes a day only!	1
73792	first few months were fine, after 2 months i experienced mood swings, depression and the worst acne of my life which did not help with my depression at all!	0
64489	hi all, i started on 50mg sertraline and 100mg diazepam(sp), hated it i just felt spaced out all the time. stopped the diazepam and went to 100mg sertraline, and it leveled my moods out, i would be the same monday as friday, but still not happy and joking as i usually am. i went to doctors today and he put me on 150mg sertraline, and 2mg diazepam as needed. yes sertraline does work, i had really bad stomach for about a month, now that's gone, i have had a few panic attacks but, they are less, i do struggle with my thought of line when i am talking, but stop rethink what i am saying then go again. i am a 46yr old male, head chef., started	1
78468	i'm i gave birth to my daughter at 34 weeks for completely unknown reasons. the drs where so set on me agreeing to take makena that when i asked about possible side effects i was told their really aren't side effects. i was scheduled for a shot today but am completely refusing to allow my drs to continue with this treatment. the side effects are terrible! the shots are painful and you'll be tender for days. i also had a ton of fatigue while taking them, but the worst is the moodiness and depression. after just a few short weeks of taking makena my emotional state has become so poor that it is safer and healthier for both myself and my baby to not continue makena. i would recommend for expecting mothers to steer clear of makena.	0
147790	i had previously been on ortho micronor, the name brand for norethindrone, 0.35 mg, for 3 years. then my insurance wouldn't cover it so i had to go on jolivette. after about a week of taking this pill, i started to experience heightened anxiety. it got so bad that i could no longer do simple day-to-day tasks such as going to class or going to a restaurant. i was having panic attacks daily. it then got to the point where i was terrified to leave my house. i was also overcome with depression. this all happened within the first 2 weeks of taking this pill. it was too horrible to endure so i stopped taking it. my mental health is still not 100% back to normal.	0
108031	i do not like the patch at all. i'd used ortho evra version years ago in college, and the only downside was the constant tiredness and mood swings. this version of the patch has produced the worst body systems, ever. the constant gas/bloating, heavy periods with cramps that last over a week, constant hunger/weight gain, and the mood swings. i've gained roughly 15lbs, but the kicker is that i do not eat a lot. i don't even have dairy in my normal diet and i do not eat fried food or junk food. it just seems like my body is packing on the weight, still. the only reason why i even gave it a 3 is because of the ease of use and not having to worry to take it. i am switching off of this soon.	0
37092	i'm 40 and had hep c for 20 years. i'm currently into my second week so i don't know if it has started to work as yet. i don't seem to have any adverse side affects, fatigue some days - not all. still manage to work long hours and look after family and horses so i guess that would make any one tired! all good up to now and looking forward to being hep c free. good luck	1
154236	i was given reglan pre surgery last month. my daughter was with me and warned me that she had a bad experience with the drug; made her anxious and weird feeling. the nurse said that the chances of me experiencing any symptoms were very low, so i went ahead and let her administer it to me. bad decision! the side effects were horrifying. i felt the need to leave the hospital and felt super anxious. luckily they were able to rinse out with saline and the effects subsided. if my daughter wasn't with me to explain, i would have thought i was losing my mind! never again!	0
81232	the best contraceptive pill i have been on. i fell pregnant immediately after stopping yaz. it controlled my pms symptoms migraines , acne weight the works. the only pill that has all the benefits. i tried others &amp; got bad reactions. this is the best of the best.	1
43860	after i was discharged from intensive care, i reported no pain, and no pain killers were given previously. after given tylenol 3 in liquid form, and i started to experience pain with an extra large headache. the pain was in my eyes, temples, and ears not to mention throat. i got cold and my legs started to shake. then i experienced more swelling in my throat than before, but i thought that this was post op normal. after the second dose i started to panic quietly inside and i couldn't get liquid advil out of my mind! the nurse only had tablets, so my husband arrived and rushed me to the pharmacy to get some chldrens liquid advil, and 30 minutes later i was pain free! i'm not touching my prescription for tylenol 3 and will tell the doc asap.	0
20960	hope that my information will be read by doctors and the creators of that wonderful and reliable website. i would like to tell, that for me the acyclovir is sometimes not working while taken as pills, but it always works very good, when given in the form of infusions. of course the doctor must fit the amount of the days when the drips will be given to a patient (it is usually 5-6 days up to 10 days) to the amount of the virus. but it always works - i recovered from the ebv thanks to that five times. i am a proof it always works this way.	1
17259	i had a single pure sensory (lacunar infarct) stroke. aggrenox was prescribed. it caused a bad headache only on the first day. i've been taking it for over fifty months. no side effects. no further strokes since the first one.	1
183909	i have allergic rhinitis since i was a kid unfortunately i was told that there is no cure for this allergy it will be with me for the rest of my life - doctors have always treated my so called sinus issue with flu medication and sinus medication to be honest it worked for a hour max and i am back where i started. a doctor prescribed kestine and nasonex almost 15 years ago i used it for the first two days and every time when we the seasons change. to-date i still use the same products and i don't regret using it since - honestly the best medication available for people who have allergic rhinitis.	1
206834	i had lots of comedones and just plain old acne. the creams my doctor prescribed were no longer working and i went to the dermatologist. he prescribed duac in the morning and retin-a 0.1% at night. he told me duac kills current breakouts and prevents them. within three days, my acne was already drying up and going away. my face was pretty dry and burned for the first week so it took a while to get used to the medicine. it's been about two months now and my skin is pimple free and now my acne scars/redness is still fading. i'm very happy with this medicine although it is quite pricey ($70 with insurance for me). dermatologist also recommended the vanicream gentle cleansing bar to wash my face with and it's great and gentle!	1
214233	so i went to the doctors and they told me i had a yeast infection. now this is my first time getting one. my doctor told me to purchase monistat 3 so i finally used my first insert last night and i didn't feel a thing but when i laid down it started itching and burning really bad unexplainable. the pain was so bad i was thinking about going to the hospital, but then i put the external cream on and about 30 minutes later i felt relieve. i wouldn't purchase this product ever again because the pain was much worse than the actual infection. i'm debating on using the second insert or not. ugh!	0
175720	my son had over half of the severe reactions to this medicine. he was prescribed this medicine for an ear infection. we spent a whole day in the doctors office being tested for everything from cancer and blood disorders to simple viruses. thankfully, we found out it was just a reaction to augmentin. our oldest son has had augmentin before without any reaction what-so-ever.	0
36518	been taking this medication for over 13 years responsibly!!! it has helped tremendously to control my pain but not without side effects of not being able to sleep well ever and constant sweating 24/7. much safer to use than oral meds and no stomach problems.	1
143700	yes i do not have a period nor do i cramp at all but i hate this birth control. the insertion was the most painful thing i've ever done. she did not numb me at and was very rude when i was crying because it hurt so bad. i also have gained almost 50 pounds... i feel awful about my self, have zero sex drive, and am going up a pants size every week. i do not recommend this at all	0
28114	i finally sought medical help for what i thought was a lifelong struggle with depression which ended up being more an anxiety disorder. i never thought i had anxiety- even though my mom and 2 sisters have anxiety disorders. i shut down, retreat, avoid, sleep- where they all become frantic. i thought i was have a heart attack one night (panic attack) and sought treatment a few weeks later. it's been about 4 months on lexapro and i realize for the first time i don't feel a general sense of dread. i actually answer the phone. i always thought it was just a funny quirk that i hated answering the phone but i now realize i was afraid. i'm on 20mg and went through really rough anxiety at the outset- stick with it!! it's worth it.	1
211699	in 3 days of use i had itchy scalp within 2 weeks i had to be taken off due to itchy rash on neck and face as it was getting worse. it has been 2 weeks on new medication and i am still having the breakout.	0
4810	i've been on belviq for two weeks and one day. i started at 145 and lost 5 on my own and was stuck. since adding belviq i've lost another 7 pounds. the trick is to listen to your brain. could i eat until i'm too full? yes. but do i? no. most of the time i don't even feel hungry so i eat half or even less than half of my normal portion. now that the temp outside is getting warmer i'm starting to run again and i'm sure it will speed things along that much more. i've been tracking my calories and i usually eat 600 or less and i don't feel deprived at all. expensive, but it's worth it. only side affects i've had is dry mouth and constipation, but that's nothing some water and a mild laxative can't cure.	1
115016	severe leg cramps at night......charlie horse.....one 5 mg pill at bedtime as needed really helps. 1/10 the amount of cramps and much milder.	1
126949	i was in the er for severe migraine/vertigo and i was scared to take any sedatives because i am so sensitive including to benadryl. unluckily i got the doctor who treated me like garbage and was so impatient; he wouldn't even let me explain myself he was just asking what i wanted... so he suggested reglan instead of benadryl. 2 minutes after i was becoming frantic; i had to pee and was ready to rip the iv out. then the nurse tells me the doc wants me to do a urine test. haha. i started tripping out worst hallucinations/panic attack. i felt like i was coming in and out of reality/ blacking out every 2 seconds. i finally fell asleep and overheard the doctor wanted to wake me up to do a psychiatric evaluation due to my reaction.	0
39756	i have been on contrave for 5 weeks. started at 346, on my way to 200. i have lost 42 lbs and not had a craving for any food or alcohol the entire time. no side effects.	1
153507	i've been taking this for about four months now, and i only really have good things to say about it. i take this everyday along with a birth control pill and the results are wonderful. i used to have moderate acne and nothing i did helped. this is the first time something really worked and my skin is 99% clear now. seeing even a small zit on my face is very rare. a few tips though: it took about three weeks before i saw results, and they weren't that impressive at first, but over time i gradually got better skin. just be patient. also, i tended to still get bad breakouts around that time of the month, but in combination with a birth control pill, that went away. so, if you have hormonal acne, i strongly suggest this! i had great results.	1
228703	it worked wonderfully for several years until i got a tooth infection. i had to go off arava for the antibiotics to kill the infection. sadly when i returned to arava it no longer worked for me.	1
38793	i have been taking 40mg of nexium twice a day for about a year. prior to that i was taking a single 40mg dose per day, however i began to have more problems with acid reflux. i began to lose my voice and had frequent chest pains. the doctor doubled my dose and it seems to have helped. no more chest pains and my voice is normal again. i did everything the doctor suggested, i don't eat or drink things that would make it worse. i elevated my bed, stopped drinking coffee, etc. now seeing reports on television how taking nexium for long periods can increase the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and now dementia, my concern level is high. i'm just wondering what other people have done to help cut back on nexium. thank you.	1
60661	i found this better than any prep i have had before. ok so it was 20 years ago. a lot has changed. i have only had my first prep had it a 6.pm. i mixed in lukewarm filtered water at 4pm and let it sit in the fridge to chill. well started working within 20 minutes. i found the taste fine and was pretty much determined to drink within 30 mins and drank the recommended water in between. probably sat on the toilet 10 times within 2 hours. slight cramping before it kicked in. a little concerned with the colour. however, feel confident the 2nd prep at 7am tomorrow will help with that. i was mindful of my eating for the last 3 days and followed their recommendations. which are food groups i generally never eat. wish you good results!	1
90871	i have been using this medication for about 6 months. roxicodone 30mg every 4 hours. it does work great takes the pain away within a short time period about 15 minutes once taken. i have had 17 surgeries and have been unable to do a lot of things until i started taking this medication. i don't feel tired or get a &quot;high&quot; feeling. i am happy i found a medication that works for me. only one bad thing - i had when some of my medication was stolen. i had to stop taking it. i thought i was going to die - i was in bed for 3 days. like they say on this site put all your medicines up and follow the directions. i wouldn't want anybody to have to go through withdrawals on this medication.	1
146839	i was prescibed xanax and it works well for things like panic attacks. i do not like that it makes me loopy by taking my prescibed mg, and if i cut it in half i feel that it doesn't work at all. xanax works very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely need it. a prn that is supposed to work like xanax but isn't addictive starts with a v so ask your doctor about that. :)	1
67300	works as well as pantoprazole for me. relatively expensive.	1
150159	i took this pill around 5:30 pm and it's 11:17 and i'm usually sleep by this time . keeps you up all night, makes you jittery, and it has you feeling like you're drunk. i hate the way i felt and it worsen the way my sinus felt. also i've experienced the heart racing and the weird dreams and blabbing off at the month. this product should be off the market	0
198972	i first got the shot 2 months ago. i got it one week before my period was suppose to start, and i didn't get my period for the first month on the shot. it was convenient, just a few cramps here and their. now that the second month hit i started feeling moody, and randomly started spotting. it has been 2 weeks now and i honestly am over this shot. never taking it again.	0
116232	humira caused me to have cardiac arrest. do not take this med. if there is anything else you can try, do it. this lowered my immune system so that a &quot;virus&quot; could attack my heart. i am lucky to be alive!!!	0
160929	this drug made me extremely tired. it was like being on heroine. barely being able to keep my eyes open. i've never been this tired in my life	0
219370	my son was diagnosed with adhd when he was 4 years old he is now 7 before finding focalin his doctor started him on ritalin he was only on it for 3 days because it made him zombified and depressive with many mood swings then he started vyvanse for a few weeks but it gave him some kind of allergic reaction in his throat. finally he was put on focalin 10ml and for the last 3 years it has been doing him great. he does awesome in school and also at home he can focus and he is happy. the only bad part is he has absolutely no appetite from 10 min after he takes the pill- 6hrs later. he drinks cyproheptad syrup 2mg to help boost his appetite while on the focalin.	1
57989	as this medicine can cause intestinal problems care should be exercised because sometimes backache is due to intestinal obstruction.	1
148451	this was the worst decision of my life ! don't ever get this thing implanted inside of you . the insertion process is tragic and i was laid out in the table for an hour of the dr trying to force it into my small cervix. i had horrible headaches, started to develop acne , and i almost had a stroke one night . my eye was twitching for 3 days then my face began to spasm and started to droop and i had to go to the er and was place on steroids . i've lost some of my hair in the front and back of my head . there is no way u can tell me that this device didn't cause this! i had this device in only for 4 weeks ! and i was at my breaking point when i started experiencing lower leg pain and numbness when i was in the grocery store.say no!	0
218956	when it worked it was great. couldn't keep my levels the same, though. when levels went too high, i got tired and shaky and could not sleep. when it went too low, i rapid cycled between mania and depression. may work for you, but not for me.	0
14191	patanase is the only medicine that helps my hay fever and helps me to function. it works fast, and clears my nose so that i can breath. whenever i am hit with an allergy attack, or just have my nose to get stuffy or runny, i know that patanase is going to work and provide relief. i go from miserable to good-to-go within 5 minutes. the only thing negative that i have to say is about the funky taste that develops in the back of your throat after using. but it is so worth it! the taste is not enough to keep me from using the medicine. love patanase. no side effects at all.	1
139329	this medicine is as effective as provigil or modafanil but side effect of loose stool and diarrhea is not tolerable but medicare leaves me no other option.i do not understand because all 3 drugs priced similar amount.running to washroom constantly is this drugs worst side effect.my bodies g.i. tract is still not adjusting at 3 weeks.	0
56437	except for a few small patches on my scalp all other areas ...legs, knees,chest, stomach, back, and inside my ears have completely cleared within 3 weeks. no side effects...so far. very happy.	1
43289	it's amazing. first the redness goes away then no more itching.	1
25244	i went off enbrel due to fungal and other bad infections. my body and brain sped up on withdrawal for a month. my ra dr. recommended to try xeljanz almost 2 years later. my arthritis got worse, and i had most of the same symptoms within one and 1/2 months. i went off and i had worse side effects of speeding brain for over three months. which included 1 month of pychiatric inpatient treatment for withdrawal. does xeljanz stand behind their drug? will i be compensated for the results. i hope to start working again in the next month or so. these two drugs have greatly impacted my health and working ability.	0
166571	i just got skyla yesterday. the pill was not working for me and i mentioned maybe wanting skyla. before i knew it my gyno was in the room with the kit read to insert it. so i was not prepared so i didn't take any pain killers. my cervix is very far up so she had to clamp it to pull it down. the insertion was the worst pain i have ever felt down there. felt like knives turning as she inserted it. after i was unclamped the pressure started to go away. i went home and took some tylonal and a nap. i woke up and went to work for 12 hours. worst decision of my life. i recomend staying home the day you get it done.it's day 2 and cramps aren't horrible but still are there and i'm spotting. i'm to afraid to put a tampon in or try having sex	1
114301	i will say this about the patch. it work for me. we're there side effects? yes. a small bit of bruising and a small rash.i was willing to put up with those side effects because i did not have one craving for a cigarette. i was very happy with the program and have remained smoke free for three years boxing day passed.	1
158204	more side effects for me than abilify~mostly anxiety &amp; light-headedness plus headaches at first.	0
208566	i have been on forteo 3 months now, i started taking it after a thyroid surgery left my parathyroids damaged. this has kept me out of the hospital and living a happy healthy lifestyle.	1
94611	abilify does not work. it is not the medication for me. my heart races i can't breathe half of the time right i get dizzy i'm panicky and unmotivated i'm droggy and always lethargic very down and it has the opposite effect. !!!	0
91117	took it for basilar type migraines triggered by fibromyalgia due to a car accident when i was 12. botox works too well in me. all the surrounding muscle of each trigger point injected locked up. this works great in my mother who has a different type of migraine	0
43783	i am currently taking this medication for moderate pain reduction. i hurt my wrist by falling on concrete stairs. it does reduce the pain and works very well. the only downside is stomach upset, nausea, and extreme sleepiness. i do not have any kind of narcotic tolerance. this medicine is for minor to moderate relief of pain, and should be used as such. this medicine in my book scores a 8 out of 10 points for managing moderate pain. highly recommend.	1
24734	my dermatologist told me to use this right over fluorouracil creme on my lip to relieve any painful symptoms. he didn't explain that the desonate itself could cause painful side effects, like swelling redness, blisters, scaling, burning sensation, cracking of skin, thinning. it's water insoluble so it's difficult to wash off once it dries. this med should be used with extreme caution and stopped immediately once these symptoms appear.	0
143723	had it placed in november 2015. first few months were great, no periods, small spotting to nothing at all. after 4-5 months i started having migraines with auras, weight gain, always tired. i snapped at my family often and the libido was gone. i didn't have the motivation to do anything. finally i started having chest pain, going down my left arm and around my back. i went to the doctor who ruled out heart attack and said it was muscular. i had the implant taken out in october 2016, butchered my arm to get it out, came to find out it was close to a nerve in my arm, causing me pain. went through a withdrawal of bad headaches 1 week after. then i felt like me again, happy, good sexual health, can't believe this implant can change a person.	0
172778	one month my doctor gave me 90 pills instead of 120 and i didn't bother to read the label, and he didn't tell me either. so, for the last week before my next apt i was going through severe withdrawals. i could not sleep at all. my pulse was over 100 (usually 60). my blood pressure was high too. i've been taking these for over 1 year now, so i don't know why he went to 90 instead of 120. i have very high anxiety, and it was not cutting it for me not being on it for a week. when i went back on it, i was just fine. i would for sure give this a 9.9 rating. best medicine for anxiety i have ever taken!	1
220121	i have been suffering from depression almost all my life. ive been on several different medications though out the last 10 years. i ended up with peripheral neuropathy last year and was sent to a neurologist, he put me on amitriptyline for the burning and he also said it will help with insomnia and my depression. i absolutely am happy with this drug!!! better then prozac, i still have feelings.(lol). anyhow if you r debating on this medication, i recommend it 100 percent. i take 100mg a couple hours before bed, unless i get upset during the day,(then ill take 25mg just to take the edge off.) then i'll just take 75 mgs before bed,	1
88692	was mildly effective for post-nasal drip. but will not take it again. causes weight-gain!!!	0
8508	i've been using ambien for a of couple months now, only taking it a few times a week when i think i'm going to need a good nights sleep. my sleep issue was that i'd wake up at around 1:30am and not be able to fall back asleep. when i take an ambien i fall asleep about 45 minutes after taking it, and don't wake up until my alarm comes on. i only use it when i know i'll have trouble sleeping (like monday mornings and i've never experienced any weird behaviors like others i've read about.	1
103266	ive been taking celebrex for a couple of yrs, i always thought it made me too tired, about a wk ago it made me so tired i fell and hit my ribs and now i have pain in my ribs that probably won't go away for wks, i decided not to refill it and just take stuff like aleve instead, all it did was create more pain by cracking my ribs or whatever it did to it, thought people should know about this side effect especially since my doctor didnt tell me about it, then i wouldnt have hurt my ribs in vain knowing that i've helped others know this information	0
138569	i am 56 years old and have done every diet out there plus i was even a director of a very popular weight loss company. even there i struggled with the cravings and getting the weight off. after i quit i started to gain weight once again. i was so disgusted with myself once again! i saw a doctor thinking here i go again, struggling, craving. why does nothing work? the doctor listened to me and recommended phentermine. the very first day i thought can this be real? the cravings were gone! i was actually thinking of other things beside food and what i was going to eat next! it felt like a miracle! 2 months later and it still feels like a miracle! why didn't doctors over the years ever tell me about this before? find a good doctor!	1
6559	increasing dose from 150mg to 300mg daily stopped suicidal ideation, but did not improve anhedonia. increased dose associated with onset of hemidyskinesia, which diminished on lowered dosage and resolved completely when drug stopped.	0
129261	i'm just so relieved after using this...i spent days and days looking up reviews to comfort myself but that only helped slightly.it was my second time being sexually active and the condom slipped on the sept 13 took the pill roughly 24 hours later.didnt feel any symptoms so i started to worry but please don't!it works.last night...sept 19th i was having brown discharge that turned into a full blown period on the 20th.im finally at ease!but ladies please get on birth control if you plan on being sexually active.active. thats the next step for me.it'll save me the headache!	1
14817	okay i used to be on lomedia, then i was put minestrin for some reason a few years ago, then for some unknown reason they stopped making that so i was forced to accept blisovi. honestly i think i hate this pill more than trump. i was fine with it for the first few couple of months (all you &quot;nice&quot; reviewers need to wait a few months to really know what you're dealing with), i barely got my period at all and sometimes not at all which was nice but also scary at first bc that has never happened. i have been on bc for over 10 yrs now and this is the worst by far. i thought i was just getting older, but i have gained weight (10-15lbs) way faster than i ever have in the past and its hard to get off. my moods are terrible and i spot now	0
123608	i'm 19 years old, 105lbs, and i've never been pregnant. i had skyla inserted about 4 days ago and so far it's absolutely amazing and worth it. i was looking for a birth control that was long term, easily reversible, effective, and something that i didn't have to worry about every single day. after lots of research an iud fitted all of the requirements. my doctor recommended skyla because it was a smaller iud with hormones. the insertion was kinda painful and uncomfortable but not anything that i couldn't handle. the pain just felt like intense menstrual cramps. the symptoms i experienced after were mild cramping a few hours after insertion, light bleeding for about a day, and nausea a couple days later. overall i am so glad i chose skyla!	1
100317	reduced my libido to absolutely nothing, daily migraines, cystic acne, cramps became worse, i had no emotions, hair loss/lifeless hair, and i gained 8 pounds within one month of starting this birth control. i just stopped taking this medication and hopefully my body will be able to get back to normal. i have taken other birth control medications in the past and none of them affected me like this one so just beware of reclipsen.	0
77683	good, but takes long duration of treatment such 7 days (4 times a day).	1
31562	i wish i would have read this before buying. my second yi &amp; the store i went to doesn't have many options to choose from only monistat &amp; generic for miconazole. first night felt extreme burning upon inserting started to lessen after a few min. but oh my, i was scared i actually burned my insides off. 30 min here i am typing this. i'm glad i don't have it as bad as most. its actually going away now. not sure wether to try the second day though. i survived tonite. it's obvious the 3day one is much worse since it has more mg of medication. no itchy feeling here thank god. do not buy this.	0
134987	aczone works really well. i had a lot of acne on my face specially on my chin area, upper lip and forehead due to bacteria infection and hormonal changes. after applying aczone for about 3 weeks i could find difference in my face and it was amazing my face was clear. so, i would recommend this to everyone and best thing about aczone is it will not make your skin too dry as other creams.	1
47586	tapentadol 50mg four times a day when required for pain . before nucynta i was taking opana ir as well as extended release formula usually alternating the two every couple of months. pain relief is controlled best by opana for me personally. however several side effects have required a change so nucynta was chosen. works great no freaky side effects and less intoxicating effects.	1
223875	this made my son so extremely tired. also changed his personality	0
194890	i'm french and am 28 years old. i had my first seizure in 2009. my neurologist gave me lamotrigine for 2 years, from 100mg daily at the beginning to 400mg at the end. the frequency of seizures has been reduced but i still had some. i arrived in usa in 2011 and my new neurologist prescribed me keppra because i wanted to have a new medication, more efficient. i take 500mg twice daily. i don't have any seizure since i started this medication, so more than one year now. i'm very satisfied so far, but of course i have side effects and it's sometimes very difficult to deal with. i'm very tired all day long, i need to sleep at least 8 hours every night. i'm like bipolar, sometimes euphoric, sometimes very depressed. i'm a different person now.	1
89470	along with celexa at 20mg, for about 5 weeks, i take 150mg of wellbutrin, and 40 mg of methadone. i've had several back surgeries so live with chronic pain. along with an improvement of depression and anxiety, i noticed that my appetite has decreased. no weight gain, maybe lost a couple pounds. i noticed improvement on the first couple days! i've tried prozac &amp; welbutrin, individually &amp; together, but not much help. i recommend giving celexa a try over any other medicines.	1
215150	i think amitiza made me more constipated and i look pregnant all the time. hate it.	0
221279	i can't remember a time when i didn't sweat! that all changed a month ago. i bought drysol and also the mild drysol for my face. i was unsure about it at first, because when i put it on, the tingling was very intense. the first day i only left it on for four hours and then washed it off because i couldn't take the tingling. the second night, i went all night...the tingling was less. i only did those two nights and i didn't sweat for almost a week. i use it under my arms and the mild drysol on my face. i do not recommend it to anyone with really sensitive skin, but i do recommend it to anyone who is desperate for a solution to their problem with hyperhidrosis.	1
11540	have had rls since i was 10 years old (now 62 yrs old). in my 20's rls really started causing me problems. i have had different types of medications, dosages and combinations. my doctor put me on .5 mg mirapex three times a day. usually only take it twice, afternoon and bedtime, unless i am having a bad day of rls. mirapex has been fantastic for me. if i am very active during the day, i take a pill in the morning. never experienced side effects. some evenings the rls stays active, i get up take a 15 minute hot bath, back to bed, this seems to resolve this problem. every nerve in my body now becomes unnerved for about 5 minutes 30 minutes after taking mirapex. my neurologist said the rls is problem since i have had rls for over 50 years.	1
119825	been taking losartan for approximately 6 weeks. does not control blood pressure. body is not adapting to it to lower blood pressure. will have to try a different medication.	0
227404	i am 51 year old on my 2nd implanon device; the first one replaced at 3 years as recommended. i did gain some weight, but it's more a water retention thing. i used to have very painful periods, which is why my gyn recommended it. i'm one of the lucky ones. have not had any periods in 5 years, (spotted a bit the first month only) and plan to continue to use the implanon until i'm completely menopausal (still perimenopausal). the only reason i can't give it a 10 is whenever my blood pressure is taken in the left arm, the implant site &quot;pinches&quot;, solved by having bp taken on the other arm, but i was told i shouldn't be able to notice it. cost a bit up front (even with insurance), but saved on prescription co-pays for 3 years so still cost effective.	1
114490	it caused severe paranoia and ultra sensitivity to all senses.	0
135401	took tamiflu on day 2 of the flu. was unbearably nauseous for about 6 hours after taking it. like, wanting to die and just wondering how to get through the next few minutes kind of nauseous. so mad at dr for not warning me. i didn't take it again. i'd rather have the flu for two weeks than go through even one more day of that.	0
122745	have had years of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. bowel movement usually only twice per week...in and out of the bathroom for several hours, cramping and pain that would sometimes give me cold sweats. then exhaustion and residual intestinal ache all day. no one understood. fiber was useless. several bouts of diverticulitis. never realized that ibs and contipation could contribute to the development of diverticulosis. to me linzess is a miracle. yes you do need to be near a bathroom and the bowel motions are mostly liquid in this first 2 weeks i have been taking it. but no pain, residual ache or exhaustion! i can take it and go to work. going out...just get up a little earlier. i even feel better and more energetic overall.	1
107743	i have one child and i always knew that i didn't want to have children so close together for the sake of my sanity! i'm not good with remembering pills so after a few scares i decided to give implanon a try. insertion was a breeze! my arm was sore for about a week afterwards, and then my arm usage was all back to normal. i haven't had any bleeding, dischagres, weight gain, lost of sex drive, headaches, etc. in fact i had a lost appetite, increased sex drive, and wonderful sex life knowing that babies wont evolve. i would recommend this product to anyone but i always say that everything is not the same for everyone.	1
87413	naproxen has not helped my pain one bit. i've been on one 1000mg tablet a day for 3 weeks. i've had so many side effects to this medication but my dr doesn't care and told me to keep taking it. i'm also on 1800mg a day of gabapentin (for nerve related pain) 40-60mg of oxycodone a day (for back pain; 2 prolapsed discs as well as spinal stenosis and age degeneration) and 30mg of baclofen (muscle relaxer) even being on all these tablets i still can't walk or stand for more than 15 minutes at a time unless i have my crutches or a trolley to take weight off. i also have nerve damage to my right leg (to the point my slipper caught on fire whilst camping and i didn't know until i smelt burning rubber, resulting in 3rd degree burns on top of my foot	0
208375	17 weeks pregnant. had a horrible cough since saturday. thursday developed fever and general feeling of unwellness. saw dr friday. took first dose of tamiflu friday night. slept the best i had in a week. saturday felt 60% better, no fever. today is sunday, feeling tired but not unwell. planning on going to work tomorrow. i did take it with food, but have has horrible heartburn when i sleep on my left from it. also, nasal drainage is worse since taking it.	1
156436	my legs and lower arms would jerk and the most irritating feeling i have ever had. i started out taking 4mg at bedtime and was very effective. now i have to take 1 tablet 3 times a day. the only side effect i have is after i take a tablet my stomach feels a little sick for about 30 minutes. i have been taking the medication now for over a year.	1
223090	i am 60 years old and have been using climara 50 patches since 2008 (9 years). it has definitely relieved the night sweats and the constant anxiety feeling. i have tried a couple of times to go on a half dose but the symptoms resume, but i will try again. i have never had problems with the patch itself. the edge can be a little sticky when i put it on, but i always wipe a smear of talcum powder around it to prevent it sticking to my clothes. i now have a serious hearing problem (not resolved) so of course i'm concerned that it may be connected with this medication, but six years ago i had a massive amount of antibiotics for a staph infection following surgery, so of course this could be the cause.	1
200789	on chantix, i've experienced constipation, gas, and nausea to the point of vomiting three or four times after taking a pill. cravings were curbed, but i found that i (and everyone else i know who used it) cheated about once a week - buying a pack of cigarettes, smoking one, and throwing the rest in the garbage. i had to come home from work this morning because i kept vomiting. i'm giving up chantix and i'm going to try cold turkey instead. the side effects are simply not worth it to me.	0
124587	i've taken oral birth control pills for years after getting an on call job i was no longer to take them at a scheduled time. i'm 23 and sexually active and would love to wait until i'm ready for my own family. insertion for me personally felt like a hardcore cramp , one like no other i had felt before but it was over quickly. one bad part! hours after i had been home i went to go outside and suddenly felt nauseas, got extremely dizzy with blurred vision i thought i was about to pass out! supposedly its normal but it was still terrifying. after the first day i have had no other symptoms (spotting ,moodiness, etc ) and have to say i love my skyla. its worry free birth control and gives me peace of mind for the next 3 years!	1
81651	i've been on this medicine for only 2 weeks and have loss 13 pounds. it has totally cut my urge of wanting high carb foods and desserts. it also has not only cut my portions but i have been able to focus on eating proteins, fruits and veggies while eating good carbs but keeping them at minimum portions. the downside is i find myself a little more emotional than usual and my stomach has been hurting more since l've increased my dosage from 0.6 to 1.2 mg. i truly don't think i need to increase it additionally and will contact my physician to see if i can remain at 1.2 mg. the other downside is that insurance sometimes give a hard time paying for this medicine and it is approximately $1200 per month otherwise.	1
211774	has not made me feel better, i started on the 25mg dosage for two weeks and went up to the taking two 25mg just yesterday as the doctor instructed. my back feels like it's burning, i have weird sensations all over my body. my mother said i looked like a crack head the way i kept touching around the neck area (where most of the sensations are. i have pimples on my face that came over night after i started taking two 25mg.	0
44364	i have been taking this pill for less than a week now. the first three days i was really nauseous. today is my sixth day on this pill and i am no longer sick from it, also my skin has almost completely cleared up. i switched to this pill from junel fe because it was making my skin break out severely. i'm very happy with tri-sprintec so far, although i've noticed i'm a little hungrier than normal!	1
197582	after operation of retina detachment and removal of silicon oil my wife had been injected with two injections in her eye viz. avastin inj twice. but the situation did not improve. doctor advised to give ozurdex injection. she was given one ozurdex injection. after giving ozurdex injection the cornea started eroding. she first faced with conjuctivities and redness in her eye after two months of this injection. she is now having a blurred vision/hazzy and cornea erosion and it is deteriorating and having redness and irritation in her eyes. this ozurdex injection is useless and not reliable. this destroyed our hope and life.	0
88705	i got sick earlier this week with the flu, which triggered a sinus infection and bronchitis. my doctor prescribed otc flonase for the symptom of sinus congestion. i began taking flonase, two squirts a day in each nostril, on tuesday. while i was in the midst of the illness, with fever, body aches, and severe congestion and coughing, i did not think there was a problem with the fact that i could not taste or smell. it is the fifth day, however, and while my sense of taste has come back about 40%, my sense of smell has not come back at all. i became curious and looked up &quot;flonase and sense of smell&quot; on the internet. apparently, people are reporting loss of sense of smell when using this product. i hope mine comes back.	0
41861	hello! i am actually starting to feel like my old self again. :) i started taking hydrocodone 10/325 4x a day 4yrs ago 1st due to c-section then found it helped my back pain from bulging discs and found a pain dr. well same for me , the 4 was not enough. when i ended my horrible relationship with hydrocodone i was up to 10 pills a day. i started stealing from my boyfriend's pill bottle and then started buying off of the street! i'm a mom of 3 gorgeous children. i couldn't believe i got to this point!! it's all i ended up knowing. i couldn't function without it! it almost ruined my life. finally i decided enough was enough and went to the er after withdrawing for 8 hrs. this was about 6 days ago . patch saved me!!!!!!	1
145227	i've had this for over 1 year and a half.. i was thinking of keeping it and getting new one once my 3 years hits. i don't normally have my period. maybe every 2 months for a week. pretty good, i love it and it doesn't bother me at all. the only downside is i have a scar on my arm.	1
54641	i have taken contrave for two months and have lost 10 pounds. it has reduced my cravings and i do not over eat or binge as i did prior to taking contrave. my willpower is very strong now and i feel satisfied after a meal. in addition i feel so much better. i am off the couch and doing chores and activities again! the drawbacks are i do seem to have an increase in dry mouth and it is $90/month after insurance coverage. however i was spending more than $3/day on poor food choices. i would recommend contrave.	1
225232	took for three days. immediately developed a craving for cigarettes. the next day i started to feel out of sorts and a stabbing pain in my heart. stopped immediately but the other drugs i took after that made me even worse. not recommended at all.	0

134721	i went to the er for extreme neck and head pain. they said they were going to treat me with a headache cocktail. the nurse shot 3 medicines in me quickly. the first was reglan. immediately after she put this in my iv i felt an intense pressure in my chest and i could barely breathe. i began to feel so restless and jittery. i wanted to jump up and rip the iv out and run. i tried to lay there and calm down but i felt terrible intense anxiety and worried i was going to die. i felt panic like never before. i thought something was wrong with me, i'm so glad i'm not alone. i'll never agree to this medicine again, and my head still hurt when i left!	0
32903	i've been taking seasonique for almost 9 months now. first month is fine, i don't get my period or any bleeding or any other side effects. as soon as the second month is almost over, i start spotting and i don't stop spotting until i receive my period at the end of the 3rd month. i spot for months straight and it's actually ridiculous. this pill is very expensive and it's only supposed to give 4 periods a year yet all i do is bleed. the spotting is little-to-no blood which is very annoying. my sex drive is non-existent which ultimately makes being on the pill completely pointless.	0
78348	i'm not gonna go into detail because it would take too long. my periods and body have been all messed up for years. normally i would have 10 day periods with excruciating cramps. tried all different kinds of birth control to help with it. nothing worked.....i have been on lyza for 4 weeks now. i'm just taking it continuously. at first i had a period that was 7 days long...i kept taking it even through my period. i just finished week 4 with no spotting or side effects so far! no blood, no period symptoms, no acne, no nothing!! i am beyond happy. i hope to keep taking them every day and not have a period. so far so good! my goal is to not have periods anymore because i'm sick of them and they cause more problems than they should.	1
150024	i used this medicine just for three days for fibromyalgia. i had immediate relief. i did have to stay in bed with a hot moist heating pad.	1
204933	i suffer from chronic migraines and every dr wants to give toradol shots to stop them. toradol is not fda approved as a treatment for migraines. it does not work.	0
165226	somewhat effective but side effects were overwhelming. nervousness, insomnia, and mental fogginess.	0
194845	i had my first seizure in 04/04/14 whilst driving and they found that i had epilepsy. the neurologist put me on keppra. it is by far the best drug i've had to take. initially it was a pain as i was always angry, depressed because i lost my driving licence and tired all the time. all i wanted to do was sleep. however, once it took this medication after 6 months, the side effects wore off and i was getting back to my old self again. happy and all that. i once forgot to take my tablets for 2 days. i had a seizure. biggest mistake i've made. i always remember to take my tablets now. i'm fit free now. please take your tablets. they do help.	1
62683	i was on citalopram for eight months for depression and anxiety. side-effects such as high fever and cough lasted for few weeks. after that i started to gain weight slowly and i had some swelling all over the body, especially on my inner thighs. i got bruises more easily than before just by pinching. it made me very tired so i had to take it in the evening. i couldn't feel the anxiety and panic but i knew they were in the background but i couldn't react to those feelings the way that i normally would. i couldn't feel any pain, i'd not get tired in exercise even though physically my body was exhausted but i just couldn't feel it. it's just a mental painkiller.	0
148977	worst experience. after getting the mirena implanted i couldn't even walk ! it was extremely painful to speak , cough , or anything that involved movement ! the process of getting it placed lasted only a minute, but the pain did not end as i intended for it to . i have also had bloating , which i have never experienced this bad ! i do intend on contacting my doctor monday morning to get it removed immediately!	0
32190	i was originally switched to wellbutrin sr, cold turkey, and suffered horrible side effects until my system got used to it. when the xl came out i was hesitant to change over, but i did so with no side effects and pretty good results.	1
51128	the z pak cleared up my bronchitis right away. however it almost instantly caused symptoms of gastritis and pancreatis that made me very ill for five months. i could eat very little but was rapidly losing weight. my doctor found low liver and kidney enzymes and suggested futher tests. a endoscopy, colonoscopy, ultrasound, several lab tests and $1700 later there was no diagnosis but after five months i gradually got better. the next winter i got another cold that turned into bronchitis and was again prescribed a z-pak. almost immediately the same symptoms occurred and i was just as sick for another 5 months. this time the connection was clear - z-pak.	0
174552	i had run out of zovirax cream and was waiting a day or so on a refill from my dr. i was having a bad breakout with 4 on my lips, ugh!! i read a lot of reviews for abreva and wish i went with my guy and not buy this crap (for $25 to boot)! doesn't work whatsoever. one review said that they actually woke up the next morning with another sore - and so did i! so upset with this product i may write a letter to them demanding a refund.	0
181887	propranolol has given me the best tremor control with the least amount of side effects. i tried 4 other medications before my new neurologist suggested this. it's changed my life. no need to increase after 6 months. some orthostatic hypotension has been an problem, but it seems to be due to mixing this with other medications required for my other health issues.	1
114002	i switched to amlodipine after dry cough from lisinoprel. cough decreased in frequency but still persists years later. on amlodipine i really went downhill, severe joint pain every joint is affected and leg and ankle swelling are really terrible. achy all the time most especially in low back and legs to the point i simply can not walk anymore. i take a few steps and the legs ache so bad they lock up and i must rest to take another step. eventually i get home but really i can't even walk anymore and have gained weight and flab.losartan is not lowering my bp and i really feel death would be a kinder more desirable event. who wants to live with this chemical straight jacket 24/7? the fatigue is so constant i look forward to going to bed.	0
158317	i used amirix with klonopin and pristiq and i sleep, finally. the combination works for me. the only problem it takes me a while to open my eyes in the morning. i am disabled so this side effect is not a problem.	1
16473	i starting taking this birth control because it allowed you to still have a period every month. previously, i had been on a bc that only allowed a period every 2 months and i don't think my body liked that. however, i stop taking generess and got an iud. after i stopped using generes, i have had the worst cystic acne on my face and body. i have been off of the pill for over a year and i still have terrible acne problems. it has gotten better over time, but it is still bad. i wish i would of never been prescribed this pill.	0
11464	i am a 12 year survivor of mirapex/pramepexole. it was a miracle to begin with. i only slept about 4hrs a night but had enormous energy and never tired. that lasted nine years. but during that time i lost bladder control, impulse disorders, loss of concentration, myalgia neuropathy, falling asleep while driving, many more and augmentation. i was on .5 mg. detoxing med free from this med was horrendous! after detox most of the side effects cleared up. but i still have issues with memory and concentration. this is the only med i took on a reg bases as my health was good. im still suffering the side effects of the withdrawl from it. studies should be for longer than 12 weeks.	0
7655	been taking it for 2 years and it gets me through anxiety attacks.	1
198908	i've been on depo for about a year, and at first i absolutely loved it. no periods and no noticeable side effects at first. however, i started noticing frequent mood swings and often feelings depressed. on top of that, i have also had painful intercourse and my obgyn says this is because of decreased estrogen levels which cause women to be less &quot;wet&quot; - which she said is very likely to be caused from the shot. i've also had serious trouble losing weight since i've been on the shot. don't do it!!	0
207071	two days ago i purchased a blistex tube called orange mango blast. it smells great however has caused my lips to swell and burn. normally i use the mint blistex and never experience anything like this. medicinal ingredients are different. is that the cause of the swelling?	0
141803	lexapro changed my life! i had coped with generalized anxiety, depression, even slight ocd since i was a child. everything in my life was affected by it in some shape or form. i have been on lexapro 10 mg for three years now and i can't imagine being without it. i'm happy with my life; work, family, friends. no more anxiety attacks or crying spells or ocd. my husband can 100 percent see the change. i only had a few side effects for the first few weeks like yawning and slight night sweats (didn't interrupt my sleep) for several months and now none. i think my doctor puts it best; diabetics take insulin because their bodies don't produce enough and people who have the symptoms above don't make enough serotonin take a medicine like lexapro.	1
33494	i have been on microgestin 1/20 for about three weeks now and the side effects were not shy. first two days i had bad migraines, the third and fourth had cramps and the fifth to seventh day i was extremely depressed. i cried over almost everything and anything. starting the second week it seemed like things were going okay until i started bleeding and it hasn't stopped. isn't that the whole purpose? i got over my period two and a half weeks ago and now i'm getting it again and there are no signs of it stopping anytime soon. good thing is i don't have mood swings or anything anymore but this excessive bleeding is now the problem.	0
99786	it tasted horrible. it did produce the expected outcome but i started vomiting and hour after each dose	1
149470	i have only had it in for a couple weeks but so far i have loved it. insertion was not bad at all (i know this depends a lot on the person). it just felt like very minor cramping for about a minute. i got it in during my period, which is supposed to make it hurt less. after insertion, there was mild to moderate cramping but went away with ibuprofen. i have had occasional spotting. sex drive is the same. i have noticed that i have to go to the bathroom significantly more often. but that's the only real complaint i have. was on the pill before and this is has been so much of a better experience. it was expensive but over the 5 years, it'll be worth it.	1
121925	i have been on effexor xr for years. i have been on several other ssris through the years that eventually stopped working. effexor has been the most successful in the long term. i take 150mg of the xr and 37.5 three times a day of the regular effexor. the regular was recently added as my depression has worsened due to additional stress at work. i have not had any major side effects, even on this high of a dose. i do agree that withdrawal is serious. if i miss a dose, i have a buzzing feeling, crying and increase in depression almost immediately. this is one medication that i do not go without--ever. i am a bit worried about ever going off of it for these reasons. i believe that this can be done safely with the help of a physician.	1
31628	i have always been prone to yis, but this is the worst experience i've had thus far. i've never experienced the burning and itching with treatment. it's always felt better as soon as i began treatment. i was actually worried that something else was wrong and wondering if i should start asking my boyfriend some questions. glad i read these reviews before i got too worked up! lol! sheesh! the burning and itching is pretty bad and i'm only on night 2. i'm very uncomfortable, but hopefully it will subside as i get further into the treatment.	0
158070	this medication worked the best of any antipsychotic for my delusions and paranoia - but the side effects were basically unbearable - akathisia was sometimes so bad i wanted to have my legs amputated.	1
119288	this is the 2nd time in a month that i have suffered from dizziness and fatigue after taking claritin. my blood pressure has dropped to 96/58 which is low even for me. i have always had lower than normal blood pressure. i last took claritin on thursday morning and this is monday and can finally stand up without feeling dizzy.	0
118358	i was clean a full 7 days before the injection as the protocol suggests. and of course the first thing i was going to do after the injection was use. so, i did 3 hours later. i could tell my receptors were blocked, but not all of them. so when i used, i flooded my still unoccupied receptors with opioids at the same time that the vivitrol blockers were moving in and immediately began bumping the opioids off the receptors. within 20 minutes after my use i was in a precipitated withdrawal. the vomiting and cramping, etc were so bad that it was a dangerous 24 hrs. has anyone else experienced precipitated withdrawal from using opiates after the injection?	1
119285	it takes so long to kick in and only works for like two hours.	0
24719	after taking 1 dose of lactase enzyme supplement 9000 units along with some ice creme i felt sick to my stomach i had stomach pains nausea just an overall feeling of sickness which lasted for most of the day	0
148185	i've had a horrible experience on this pill. i started taking it after my third child and it has absolutely altered my mental wellbeing. i have been depressed, anxious, nervous, angry, it's been a nightmare. stopping right away, good to know i'm not the only one going through this.	0
40925	i have been going too a pain clinic for 6 years was on norco 5/325 helped for a while till my body got use to it so dr switched me too perocet/oxycodone 5/325 been on it for 3 months as for pain been helping really good atleast for me and right now on scale one through ten it bring my pain from a 8 down too a 4 or 5 depends how bad i'm hurting ( have buldging l4&amp;l5 disc in back and si joint problem alone with athritis and muscle spazams) that gets so bad that i can't stand for long periods or sit long nor can i lift a lot hevy stuff including my kids without hurting but since i been on this my pain ant pain free bits it's manigable so i would highly recomend it but if you have to take it make sure you eat first will make you feel nauseated	1
77582	drug works, but it can nearly kill you. side effects for me were same as heart attack. if your allergic it can kill you. take at your own risk. if you are allergic to penicillin do not take it. dr will tell you only 1-10% of people show reactions, but you could be that 1 % and be dead too. it was a bad experience.	0
45369	i have been on prozac now for a while as i suffer from ocd and ptsd also. i feel as if it has made me crazier, if thats possible. some days i can't stop twitching, feel full of energy and experience nausea. other days my bones hurt, i feel not fully awake and just odd. keeping in mind that daily, i have a high levels of caffeine and smoke marijuana. and not daily, but weekly i drink quite a bit of alcohol. i have noticed alcohol and prozac really don't mix. but nevertheless, i am still taking 20mg daily (which i do not think is enough) but then some days i want to stop taking it altogether? i do not although prozac doses shouldn't be skipped but evidently the only words i can use to describe this drug is odd and weird and idk???! uugh	0
62835	i love celexa and am grateful that it works for me. after my 1st panic attack in may 07, my doctor put me on zoloft. at first i liked it because it really helped with the anxiety immediately. i then noticed it made me feel like a zombie, the lows weren't as low, but there were not any highs anymore either. i had a few bouts of &quot;rage&quot; as well. after getting pretty depressed this winter 07-08, i went back to the doctor and it was actually the nurse practitioner who changed my medicines to celexa. i was on 20 mg for 2 weeks and then she increased it to 40 mg. i have been on the 40 mg of celexa now for 2 months and have never felt better. i am calm and happy but still feel like my funny self.	1
131879	i was put on effexor 37.5 for hot flashes. i had uterine cancer and went into very fast menopause. after trying to live with the hot flashes for about 6 months, i asked for help. effexor has been wonderful. i am now able to sleep through the night. i really only have a hot flash when i forget to take my medicine.	1
160279	28 female- i was diagnosed with bipolar, manic depressive when i was 14. i have been on an off of medication for years. when i approached my pcp for medication for my anxiety they were nervous about giving me a ssri due to they make me manic. they tried giving me abilify but that landed me in the er. buspirone was my last resort. it's been about 4 weeks and what a difference. i'm enjoying my life with my kids, family, and friends again. i used to go everywhere with no problems but the past 7 months i could barely leave my house. i shut down completely. buspirone is changing me back to the person i was. my anger has diminished. my paranoia is gone. i can go out in public without a panic attack or racing thoughts.	1
71255	it burns at the beginning but within a few minutes stops the pain associated with severe psoriasis. it numbs the affected area for relief.	1
174309	this is terrible, honestly. i was on ortho tri cyclen but then my pharmacy told me i ran out of refills. ever since i was put on this i have gained 10 lbs in 3 months (which i haven't gained/loss more than 3 lbs in over 5 years). my moodiness has caused me to start fights with my boyfriend like crazy and i feel awful almost 24/7 even though i'm on prozac as well. the only thing that works is the actual birth control part.	0
133964	originally i was using a different brand but since getting switched to this.. i &ldquo;spot&rdquo; bleed all the time. i&rsquo;m going off birth control after this pack .. since i'm due to have a period soon anyways. i&rsquo;ve been bleeding for 3 months straight. i&rsquo;m haven&rsquo;t been sexually active for almost a year. who needs it with all these side effects?	0
97387	why on earth any company would add fragrance to a medicine is beyond me when so many medical facilities have gone fragrance free. even the low level fragrance has caused nausea after a half day's use. it's either the fragrance or a reaction to the gel. didn't make much difference in my pain level.	0
172624	i have spent years not getting proper sleep. i went to visit the hospital and the doctor stuck me on clonazepam when i told him about my sleeping issues. since i have taken it i have been able to sleep good. still a bit early to tell but so far i give it a 7 out of 10.	1
141380	starting lexapro was tough. shivering with stomach cramps, for a week i constantly felt like i had taken some bad, terribly impure ecstasy. once i became acclimated to the drug, my postpartum anxiety disappeared; however, i was incredibly fatigued during the day. i also stopped caring about most things in general. my house wasn't as clean and creative endeavors came to a halt. my short term memory declined. it felt like my brain was muffled. i experienced lucid, unnerving dreams/nightmares most nights while taking lexapro. i gained 8 pounds in the 8 months i took it, all in my middle. it took a long time to get this off afterward. getting off lexapro was also tough, with back pain, insomnia, and 10 days of &quot;brain zaps&quot;.	0
105928	this medication was not a good match for me. i was dizzy, nauseous and sleepy. i had to move very slowly in order not to make side effects worse. i only took one 45mg dose. i was given a verbal list of possible side effects from the pharmacist. i tried to keep an open mind as everyone may not experience negative side effects but in this case i did. i am an adult with add so i was prescribed this to help symptoms of inattention. the side effects lasted 24 hrs.	0
13424	i was 23 when i was diagnosed with adhd. started adderall, i take 30 mg of sr a day and the difference is phenomenal! i get up with ease because i know i can tackle all tasks with astounding motivation and actually enjoy doing tedious work. i am co-morbid with anxiety, rumination, and i was highly neurotic. i found myself aggressive, quick tempered, and easily abusing marijuana and alcohol. this all changed with adderall, i am rational, reflect on situations in a positive light, and generally just a more helpful and kind person. adderall completely saved my professional and personal life. side note, it can cause erectile dysfunction but it will go away after your body is used to the cycle.	1
8149	i'm taking this medication as prescibe by my doctor it has not helped at all in fact the third time taking it i did not feel sleepy nor did i fall asleep	0
120254	do not take this. research this drug before giving it to your child. it has been known to cause neuropsychiatric episodes when taking it. it is a very dangerous drug and i would not recommend this to anyone, at any age.	0
55568	if you are new to taking this medication or are currently on warfarin, here are a few things to keep in mind: (1) when you start this medication you will likely have a lot of acid - be sure to take ranitidine but in half the dose most physicians will prescribe. zantac and other meds will change your body's ph and make you likely to get yeast &amp; fungal infections (2) there is no way to reverse the effects of pradaxa which is a big issue if you are bleeding in a hospital's er. (3) pradaxa is great when it comes to diet. you can eat all the broccoli &amp; vitamin k you want. (4) pradaxa does not require biweekly blood tests. (5) your joints will ache after 90 days on pradaxa (6) vein pain is common.	1
198714	i started the depo in july to help with my endometriosis. first shot went fine, i didn't start bleeding until the end of august. from that point on its been hell. there was a time where i went a month without bleeding. i am due for my 5th shot in february. i highly doubt i will get it. it's not heavy bleeding but it's enough to drive you insane. i also had a myometmy (the surgical removal of fibroids from the uterus) i'm not saying the depo caused a cyst but i got a cyst on my ovaries. i read someone else had one too. i'm just really over it. i rather just have a steady period each month and go from there. honestly, this isn't worth it. and it's not even guaranteed it will help my endometriosis.	0
180542	my dad was put on breo for his copd however he had asthma as well. the breo made him worse and the doctor told him it needed to get into his system for it to work properly. well after being on it for 3 weeks he died!	0
94833	starting on day two of treatment i felt progressively sicker with mild nausea, muscle aching and general malaise.	0
90441	bought abreva at the first day by middle of the night lip had a blister big one after applying it. 5 days later lip still has a nasty spot and a bit swollen . i do believe i could have just saved my $20 and probably wouldn't have been different . help with pain a bit yeah but healing it fast no.	0
218857	i am not very fond of depakote. when i took it it didn't improve my moodswings that much. in the beginning it made me nauseous &amp; caused my hair to fall out. no, i didn't go bald, but it thinned out my hair enough that my hairstylist noticed. eventually, my hair stopped falling out, but i gained a lot of weight &amp; i had very bad tremors &amp; bad coordination. if you do decide to take this medicine make sure your doctor tests your blood regularly. i think you are supposed to have your blood tested every 6 months.	0
122870	i began talking this pill 4 months ago to help with my pmd. the 2-3 weeks following my period i had extreme irritability/anxiety. my periods were also very heavy and accompanied by severe cramps and extreme fatigue and headaches. my doctor recommended this pill to level out hormones and help with cramps. this pill has been amazing. my periods are 3-4 days long and very light. i have no cramps. my face has cleared up except for a couple breakouts on my chin the last day or so of my period, but they are gone in a couple days. i feel so much better on this pill. incredibly lower levels of irritability/anxiety.	1
150410	i was prescribed this a few months ago, i took the first day's pills and had a horrendous headache, but i'd taken many medications before it and had pretty similar experiences and the side effects usually dropped after a week or two. so i kept at it with this stuff for another 2 1/2 weeks, and still the same headaches. so i stopped taking it, i didn't notice a change in my skin either. maybe i'm just sensitive to this.	0
66078	i have read most of the posts, i am so glad this medicine has helped so many but unfortunately i am one if the few that it did the opposite. i have been on topamax, a bit effective but i created a fast resistance to it and the constant &quot;idiot&quot; mode, fatige, tingling and memory loss made me decide to ask him to change me to something else. since you can't be taken off topamax cold turkey i was advised to take 50mg and one 60mg of propranolol, the first 5 minutes it felt like i had taken a good 5 shots of tequila without the gagging. after that i left as if someone had dropped a bucket of ice water on me and then a nasty migraine...4 hours later i'm without a breath barely feeling my legs.	0
56847	i have noticed breast tenderness with this medicine, which is definitely a little weird. i am not pregnant or nursing. as long as i take the medicine exactly on time (every 6 hours) my vertigo is kept at bay.	1
223201	i had ovarian cancer and had an oopherectomy, my oncologist wanted me to use this drug for at least 10 years, started with higher dose and have gone down to 0.05, have tried dropping it to 0.025, but noticed i was having the hot flashes and lack of sleep at night, gone back to the 0.05 and enjoy it so much more, although i am now going on my 12th year of taking it. trying to wean off of it but without the ovaries it is hard. love this patch!!	1
55094	i have been on contrave for almost a year (40 y.o female). i started out at 240 and now i'm 190. granted it would have been more but after my husband passed away i didn't really watch what i've been eating and i haven't been excercising the last several months. when i first started taking it i had headaches and nausea but it didn't last long. what i love about it is that it makes you not obsess over food and it does keep you in a more cheery mood. really great med.	1
196976	hello, paxil ruined my life. the first month was great and then is turned horrible, like horrible. if i missed one pill i would get the most horrendous serotonin withdraw, so horrible my fore head would burn, nose would run, i would snap on anyone around me. then it just turned into that was just how i was, if one tiny thing went wrong i was the most dramatic individual ever, hysterically crying (like rolling around on the floor crying, sweating hyperventilating) over things that weren't even a big deal. it has put so much strain on my relationships i don't think some are repairable. coming off of them seemed next to impossible,then i switched brands, the pink ones are like poison the white are bearable. do not take this drug, seriousl	0
224183	synthroid is only one of the four hormones produced by the thyroid. so it produces about the expected mediocre result. for me it was worse than mediocre, it was horrible, leaving me essentially bed-ridden for almost 3 years. this company has a bad record, and pressure is put on docs to use this stuff exclusively. why aren't we offered other options at the start??	0
168470	for a little background, i had my 1st yeast infection at 20 after a course of powerful antibiotics. ever since, i got them every 3-6 months for the last two years. mine almost never itched, but the discharge is just... unappealing, no? i find monistat is really a &quot;facilitative&quot; cure. i take the 7-day, which is less concentrated than the 1 day many doctors advise against (i'm also a premed graduate) so i experience no burning. just a little warmth. for me, monistat helps clear up the yeast so i can tackle the real problem: improper ph and bacterial imbalance. ladies, try the 7-day miconazole with a good, refrigerated probiotic - at least 15 billion cultures! i'm not sure about chronic sufferers, but i was recurrent and it worked.	1
108745	i got nexplanon after my surprise son and had no periods for a year however i had no sex drive, it was painful even, and cramping but no period. then the flood gates let loose and i started having 2 week periods with hormone fluxes, hot flashes, weight gain and acne. so after a few months i got it removed and got a non hormonal iud and i bleed for 3 weeks. then had a week off. then had another period. still having issues and i don't see them going away any time soon. super unhappy with this product.	0
16463	this was my first experience with birth control and i hate it. this pill made my periods even more irregular than they were prior to taking this pill. i've been on this pill for almost 9 months and not once has my period came on time. it is so stressful because i honestly never know when my period is going to come. i gained 4 pounds and i have crazy weird dreams overnight.	0
213389	i had acne all of my and i am 60 years old. i came across this stuff 30 years ago and it's wonderful. like the comments before me.......it does leave a white film on your face, but i apply it at night. when i do have a break out and dab a thicker amount on that area and in a two days it's dried up and gone. if you use this properly it's the best out there. plus i feel it keeps my skin from aging. since it does dry out your skin the aging spots pretty much fade out. i would seriously give this product a try since i can tell you that i did true everything out there. i hope this helps one person if not a lot more. why have unwanted acne on your face and go thru life like that. a little pricy but it's your face where talking about.	1
196255	this medication did help improve my mood slightly, but had interactions with other prescription medications i was taking at the same time. it is very important to inform your doctor about what medicines you are taking and it is also very important to ask if there are any contraindications with these medications. this should not be a problem if you have a good relationship with your doctor.	0

194069	well i was diagnosed as being positive for about 5 1/2yrs now. no biggie, i didn't/ no one deserves it, but i was unintentionally asking for it. anyways i first found out my viral load was a 50,000 and my ts were 540. clinic didn't want to put me on meds right away, but anyways... like 4ish years later my viral went from 50,000 to a million something and ts dropped to the mid 20s. several tests here and there, i went from a million back to a 50 and then my ts went from 20s back to the 500s. now got results, my viral went from 50 to the very low teens and my ts went from 500 to mid 750. stribild i love you.	1
64449	i have been suffering with depression since i was 9 years old. i was also diagnosed with ptsd, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and ad/hd. i was going to start medication years ago, but found out that i was pregnant and unable to start a medication. after i delivery i developed ppd bringing the end of our relationship. a year later i decided that it was time for me to start taking a medication. i started out on 25mg daily and i felt better within days, but was still have depressive episodes, so moved up to 50mg. i have been on 50 for 2 months and still have some depressive episodes during my cycle but it's manageable. i have trouble sleeping but that's really it. my appetite has lessened but nothing major.	1
127587	way too much stimulant--increased heart rate and blood pressure immediately after taking one pill.	0
190531	i suffer from cranial-facial hyperhidrosis. it is really bad, to the point it can look like i have sweat soaked hair and face. it's the worst indoors when i am shopping, walking around, work meetings, etc. seriously, the most embarrassing and socially debilitating issue i have every experienced. i have gone to the dermatologist for botox injections in my scalp several times and it works a little bit, but nothing great. after doing research, i decided i needed to try an oral medication. i am glad i did, oxybutynin works really well for me, i am so happy. i usually need 5mg 3x daily to get through the day. i get dry mouth pretty bad, but gum or lozenge gets me through that problem pretty well.	1
184162	i was dealing with stress and anxiety super bad after my second baby was born, about 6 months ago...i was prescribed 25 mg to help. i would take the pill when i was feeling super stressed and anxious and felt soming, i guess, very subtle, i was hoping to feel an obvious calm about my body and thoughts...not with this med. i also had very vivid sacked out dreams and the worst part hands down is the fog of exhaustion i would feel the next day! don't take this if you need to be productive or need quick relief from anxiety, at least that's my experience.	0
78913	been on livalo for two months now and it did not change my cholesterol levels. still at 285/212. no symptoms or side effects. just does not work for me.	0
160345	my mild anxiety had been building for yrs when i decided to seek help for it. at that time, i had only experienced one panic attack after a health scare (heart palps from over exercising). it wasn't until i sought help to control my stress that i was prescribed prozac. started having panic attacks and taken off. started taking buspar. 1st few wks were really rough (brain zaps). it kept me from having panic attacks but i still experienced moderate anxiety every day. after 8 wks, i started to experience depression for no reason and intrusive thoughts. nothing like i ever experienced before. so i went back down, depressive thoughts came back. tapered off. lightheadedness, ear ringing and brain fog persisted the entire 3 mo. i was on it.	0
154286	i was ticked at first when tricare prime refused to pay for the nexium i had been prescribed when on active duty. tried the va too and they said no too. va prescribed omeprazole and after two weeks of 40mg/day taken before two meals, i'm fine! no reflux. ok so far. good because i like saving money.	1
64935	this helped my panic attacks stop, but helped with depression none. this medication made me feel 'flat,' and like i was not living in the moment. for example, when people talked to me i could not associate emotions with the conversation. in addition, this gave me stomach irritation, made me lethargic, and never worked at the 4-6 week mark.	0
171051	i've now been on this drug for 5 months. i haven't self harmed during this time. i have gained some weight, although in recent weeks i've been able to stop bingeing for the first time in years. i tend to wake up feeling down or agitated, so perhaps the pills aren't working for the full 24 hours. however, once i've taken the medicines i am calm again. the major downside is that i easily sleep for 14 hours straight and find it impossible to motivate myself to do anything. the days go by very quickly and i do little other then eat, sleep and watch tv. in the long term this has to be a bad thing, but for now i'm happy not to be feeling ill.	1
138389	i posted a thread on january 31, 2014. i weighed in on friday at 172lbs. i am roughly 66inches, i've been taken this medicine for a week, and i have lost 10lbs. i weighed in about an hour ago and i am 162.4 pounds. i would say, its working. my goal is to get to 157-160lbs.	1
166871	i had unprotected sex on may 28th. he ejaculated outside, but because we did it a couple of times, i freaked out. i took opcicon one step 4-6 hours later and felt the side effects immediately. i was slightly nauseous, fatigue, had lower abdomen cramps and bloated the first week. one week later (june 4th) i bled for 4 days, spotty with dark blood. i continued feeling bloated, indigestion, stomach cramps, sharp/dull pain in nipples, and extreme mood swings from stress and hormones the entire month of june and the first week of july. my period for july was late so i took over 10 pregnancy tests (all negative) over the course of 1 month but i finally got it today! it's heavier than usual and i didn't even feel it coming but i'm not complaining!	1
79318	i have wanted to share my experience for some time to help other ladies out there. i have taken the plan b pill twice and it has worked for me both times. each time it was because semen/ejaculation had gotten inside me and into my vagina. when this happens i quickly try and do my best to &quot;flush it out&quot; then i use the restroom and pee. after doing this i took the plan b pill right after, the first time was less than 24 hours after the incident. the 2nd time it was around 20 min after sex. each time i have gotten my period around the time it was supposed to come. now i may just be lucky and i know not all women can say the same. i hope i was able to help.	1
66145	lowered blood pressure but, caused severe hair loss (i saw clumps of hair in drain after every shower) and depression! i have since learned that this 'side effect' is known as 'beta-blocker blues'. however, my m.d. switched me to tenormin (another beta-blocker) which did not have these side effects.	0
60469	i have to take pyridium. have been taking it for many years. my urologist says i don't have interstitial cystitis but my bladder started burning in 1992 and hasn't stopped, so it may be urogenic bladder. pyridium does seem to make me drowsy and i itch a lot. but not sure if the pyridium causes it as i'm on many other medications. it does help the burning of my bladder.	1
16837	i have been taking yaz for about two months now. i stopped taking birth control about two years ago and started to break out with acne horribly. i was on the patch and gained about fifteen pounds. i lost all of that weight and now am 117lbs again. i was worried that i would gain weight after losing it so my dermatologist told me to use yaz. yaz has been wonderful. i have not broken out severely, maybe one or two on my chin. it is completely fabulous for acne and for birth control.	1
91164	i have been having injections for over 1 year now. the dosage was increased, per my request, in december. this seemed to work well, although it still didn't last any longer. i went in in march for my next dose, which was the same as december, and this time it's just awful. i have constant tremor, i have jerky movements at times, neck pain, yet i can tell that muscles are definitely weaker....if fact even more so than last time. is this a sign of too much? or injection error? i am seeing a neurologist, i did have 1 appointment with a movement disorder specialist (3 hours away), does anyone have suggestions? should i return to the specialist?? any input is appreciated!	1
143125	this is definitely one of those &quot;everyone reacts differently&quot; kind of birth controls. see how you react to a progestin only pill and then try this, they are very similar. for me, this little rod has been a nightmare. i waited several months to see if my hormones/ periods would even out and they never did. i already struggled with depression and this made my moods totally unstable and made my depression and anxiety symptoms skyrocket. i also have a strangely heavy period every other week and experience more pms symptoms because of it. i'm super fatigued all the time and achy fairly often. i also think the constant periods have made me seriously anemic which doesn't help with that. proceed with caution.	0
31371	i bought monistat 3 and just like everyone else on here, i am on fire. the first night, i was on the bathroom floor crying and scratching, it was the worst pain i've ever been in. the next day, my symptoms were nearly all gone, so i figured the medication was working, so i used the second dose and i regretted it so badly. update!!! i'm now on day 3. i noticed that on the previous days, the burning was only on the external vagina, so i put vaseline all over the area before inserting the cream so it doesn't touch my skin. so far, this is working and i don't feel anything.	0
210640	makes you feel really sleepy and tired in the morning	0
127334	my son is 5 years old, he is autistic his doctor said to try melatonin. i give him 3mg at night 30 minutes later he is sound asleep. it has been great. no more fighting him to lay down. i was scared to use it, but now i know it works. he hasn't slept good since he was born. before melatonin i felt like i still had a newborn, waking up and not sleeping. i highly recommend this for autistic children, of course check with their doctor first.	1
94805	this medication has been fantastic. my depression was pretty significant as there was nothing i wanted to do anymore other than go to sleep at night. i felt like my life was gone. someone took it. after seeing the reviews on here, i started taking abilify (10 mg) and it works fantastic. i started to notice a difference on the second day and i have now been on it for three weeks. i feel great. i feel like my life is back and i want to do things again. it does make you sleepy so i take it at night before i go to bed. i had a very slight increase in hunger but it was totally manageable. as long as you don't feed your face every time you feel hungry, and you stick to your normal eating amount and schedule, you wont gain any weight.	1
144282	i got this implant about 16 months ago, and at first, i hated it and i wanted to get it removed. but, i kept telling myself to just give it another month, and i'm glad i did. like many others, i experienced a lot bleeding and spotting. i would spot for two weeks, and be on my period for a week. i was off my period for only one week. it was very frustrating. i lived with that for a year. at the year mark, things changed - i stopped getting my period! i only spot for a day or two, and only once or twice during the day. at the begging, i did experience headaches, but that only lasted for about a week or two. i am happy with this implant.	1
270	honestly the best birth control i've been on. i had to switch from the pill to the shot due to medications i am on and i have had no problems with this birth control. of course i gained a couple pounds but thats just a given. i gained maybe five pounds so nothing drastic. will continue to use!	1
56222	made my symptoms worse and caused even more issues. the pain from the injection wasn't bad but the side effects were horrible. i say avoid this drug	0
58266	i like how it cleans out my ear. it calmed down my pain in 2 days. i'm using 4 drops twice a day. the only problem is a little loss of hearing, i believe it's the wax built up inside my ear and the infection. now i'm going to get my ear cleaned by my doctor today.	1
76234	just started this med 2 weeks ago. i feel awful: generally ill feeling (like a cold or flu), severe headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramping (feels like i've done a massive workout and let the muscles cool down without stretching), muscle weakness (where it's a chore to lift arms and legs...skin pain, too), trouble sleeping, i can feel my heart pounding and hear it in my ears, coughing, and i don't know what else. i have spoken to my doctor and been told this will go away, but i'm concerned. my vision wasn't great before, but seems worse now. not sure what to do...	0
87437	i have siaticia from lower lumbar to right leg all way down . been taken this just today and i can safely say it's the bees knees. totally fine to take and works a treat.	1
111527	i went to the er last night because of a pulled back muscle that occurred 2 weeks ago...the pain(lower back) was just unbearable! and when the pain also moved up to my kidney i thought &quot;ok something is seriously wrong here...turns out i had a pretty bad uti that i didn't know about (none of the usual symptoms, pee flow regular, no spotting, etc.) 1st time ever being prescribed cipro, 500mg 2x a day. took 1st dose immediately after filling my script(10pm), second one 12hrs later(10am) by morning i had severe dry mouth after taking 2nd dose so i started drinking a gatorade and immediately started vomiting, my kidney hurts more than it did before going to er, headache since last night, and i'm only on day 1 :(	0
64705	well i have been on sertraline for 9 weeks and i feel it's been a huge benefit for my social anxiety , i've always been a generally shy person but in the last 3 weeks especially i've been seeing a huge increase in confidence in different social environments. i haven't had a panic attack in 9 weeks which is rare and i believe that is due to this medication and it's positive effects that it's having on my overall outlook on life. it hasn't all been plain sailing though, the first 2 weeks especially where quite rough with headaches and some heart palpitations, but the worst thing i found where the excessive sweating which still happens now. i stared on 25mg for the 1st 4 weeks now on 50mg. benefits outweigh the negatives. stick with it.	1
175892	i was prescribed cephalexin for a 20 day course for a horrid sinus infection. i had a throbbing headache, lots of mucus, etc. but i wasn't feeling any better so i was prescribed levaquin. within the first three days of using levaquin i felt incredibly tired; just weak, laying around all the time, and unable to sleep during the night. my eyes felt droopy all the time, i was dizzy standing up, my heart raced when i walked up the stairs, and finally on my fourth day taking the medicine i was startled. this had been going on for a couple days, but my head and left shoulder started twitching consistently. i literally could not keep them still. i got worried and called the doctor and was told to stop the drug. i guess it was too powerful for me!	0
202624	i am a 54yr old female, just diagnosed with ra two months ago. i also suffer from fibromyalgia. started taking placquenil exactly one month ago, along with lyrica. had only been taking the placquenil for two weeks when i had a severe reaction , dizziness, abdominal pain nausea and vomiting. was hospitalized for 4 days and am still recovering from drug induced vertigo. this is week three of vertigo, i can't drive or work and have no benefits. i was hopeful this drug might help me, now my future is uncertain cause i can't work and have no income. its thursday and tomorrow my mortgage and other bills are due and here i am literally spinning out of control.	0
179531	i had fairly mild acne, but when i went to the doctors it had been flaring up, and looked quite bacterial. when i first started using it i was happy, as it appeared to clear up my spots in less than a week, but after maybe the third use (i was using it once per night) i noticed my skin was very dry, but was not too worried as this is a known side effect. unfortunately, the dryness only got worse, even when i used it after moisturiser, and even stopped using it. it got to the point where my skin was so dry and irritated that it was bright red, and i could barely splash water in my face without it stinging. if i used cleanser my face would sting so badly i cried. it took 3 weeks to clear up, and i was left with chemically burnt skin.	0
88996	i took this medication to get some relief from severe allergies. it helped with the allergies but i ended up in the er with chest tightness and some tingling sensations in my chest. i had a battery of tests on my heart, all was fine. this medication made me feel bad on one day, worse on the second day with the chest discomfort.	0
30973	decided to try this medication over the counter, all i have to say is.. it is evil! this medicine burned me instantly. it was the worst pain i ever felt. it also cause intense itching and swelling in my vagina. lord i tried so hard to deal with the discomfort but i was in the bathroom soaking in the tub trying to wash it away. do not try this medicine!! it should be taking off the market. it was worse than the yi itself.	0
70563	i have frequent kidney stone attacks. on one trip to the er i was given a prescription for flomax and decided to fill it. next time i got an attack i took one and was amazed that the stone passed within about an hour! normally i would have been in agony for hours before passing the stone. i make sure to carry flomax with me now. two days ago i got another attack, took one flomax and the pain stopped and the stone passed shortly thereafter.	1
182300	i never received any relief.not sure if it even works. i followed directions, just awful product.	0
219918	terrible!! it has been 4 weeks and i have been experiencing insomnia. i tried every naturalpathic remedy and method that one can think of; eft, meditation, hops, chamamille, on and on and on... nothing worked.. so, i broke down, went to the doctor and he gave me this medicine. i told him that i lay there and think - nothing negative, i am a happy person, but just lay there thinking about stuff. this medicine made me crazy; i was pacing and angry and pulling my hair (metaphorically speaking). it is a psychotropic drug - nasty stuff! so, as i sit here angry at the doctor for giving me a psychotropic instead of a sleep aid, i am getting more and more irritable.... in the trash it goes!	0
190192	i have been on this birth control for a month with minimal problems. i was on another one before but had to switch due to how emotional it made me. trycyclen lo balanced my mood out pretty well. i had no spotting but when i got my period cramps were a little harsh. my boobs grew a little bit bigger and became sensitive. i was a little nauseous the first few days of the birth control but that settled itself. my acne cleared up pretty well! overall a good trusty birth control.	1
117570	i started having episodic migraines when i was 8, and it turned into chronic migraine when i was 16 (i'm 18 now). untreated, i usually have a migraine every day. after playing with a few different treatment options, my doctor put me on pamelor. 50mg for the first two months, and then 100mg for the second two. almost as soon as i started taking it, i started experiencing the adverse side effects. dry mouth, light-headedness, exhausted 24/7. but the worst were the nightmares. vivid, every night. i would wake up screaming. i stopped the medicine two weeks ago, but the nightmares still haven't stopped. and the medicine made absolutely no difference in my migraines. still had them every day.	0
176215	this med. was given as anti anxiety medication. straight knocked me out an hour after taking. girl friend took it. she some how functioned to go to work. i was completely unable to cut hair, even unable to get out of chair. anxiety was gone. and u should only take this drug short term then wean off it.my girl friends dr. doubled her dosage from 1mg to 2 mg and without it she completely freaked out, yelling, screaming at me. she completely changes her personality if without it. when she stopped taking it, it was like she was coming off heroine. was a worse situation coming off it, dr. did not lower her dose slowly, nor gave her something that could help her come off it. mixed with cymbalta? even worse. mass hallucinations, both bad drugs.	0
154257	i started with really bad nausea and sick to my stomach when i went to my gi doctor i was diagnosed with due densities and chronic gastritis. i was so sick with nausea twenty four seven i literally felt like i was going to die. i actually told my gi to prescribe me nexium 40 mg. my gi was hesitant but i insisted took it for a about a month and half and on my second endoscopy my chronic gastritis had gone down to mild gastritis and the nausea is almost gone. nexium really helped me i don't know about the side effects since i took it at night. but the nausea was still persistent it's just now going away. i can tell you this is one of the best medicines. stops the acid production by 95 percent something i had to find out on my own. good luck.	1
209353	for a month after starting this drug i was very cold especially my legs, and could not get warm, and i was very shaky and trembley. i felt miserable and didn't realize what was wrong until i stopped the drug and everything went back to normal right away.	0
20090	the most important thing about having a uti, is making sure a urine culture is done. many don't realize that there are antibiotics that simply just won't work because the bacteria they have, are resistant to the antibiotic prescribed. just because the antibiotic didn't work for you, doesn't mean it won't work for others. i've been prescribed cipro and bactrim for utis in the past, but after the abt course my uti kept coming back with a vengeance. macrobid was the only antibiotic that was able to clear my bladder/uti infection. i've seen that sometimes it can make you feel worse before you feel better. urine culture and sensitivity test is key for those suffering from recurrent infections.	1
148966	one of the worst things i've ever done! was excited to get it as no longer had to worry about contraception but i was wrong. i had it inserted in october which was not very painful. felt ok then in the middle of november started bleeding constantly. checked with the dr and she said it would ease, i bled all the way through to mid february when i finally got it taken out. i was so depressed. so was really happy i had it removed and thought it was over until i started getting the most severe pain and ended up in emergency with an infection. i ended up on 3 courses of antibiotics. it's now the following november and am only just feeling like my normal self.	0
75397	i don't think it works all that great. i don't feel any side effects.	0
180220	after taking evista 60 mg. for 5 years for treatment of osteopenia, my recent bone density test, the -04.2 which is osteoporosis. even though my insurance would not cover it, esp. now that i am on blue cross blue shield/anthem prescription plan,. evista is on the 5th tier so they do not cover it. i took it in good faith, believing it would strengthen my bones, now osteoporosis. i am 69 years old and was shocked after my dr. told me. now, they want me to see an rheumotologist to discuss taking prolia. (i know nothing about this medication.) how can i trust this will be a good prescription when evista made the bone loss worse.	0
217581	i am only on day one but i have terrible side effects. i was told to take 1 x 500mg twice a day. i don't know if i will be able to go the full 7 days. i feel incredibly hot, rapid heart beat, nausea, body aches, unpleasant taste to mouth, headache.	0
217399	day 3 . absolutely no side effects. ear and throat relief after one day. sinuses are still on fire. might be viral cold.	1
729	i had extreme pain from endometriosis along with multiple surgeries including an appendectomy when a huge cyst ruptured and irritated it. i was barely able to work due to constant doubled over pain and ruptured cyst. now i'm on depo, i got the shot in early january and am due at the end of march. so far i haven%u2019t gained too much weight although i notice some water weight. i only started spotting this month for a week, the next week was heavy bleeding, now i'm back to spotting. i just started getting a bit of acne but nothing to bad. my beautician and i noticed some areas where my hair thinned out and my hair is already kind of thin. i'm trying the low dose for march and i'm going to take vitamin b complex to see if this helps.	1
77871	this antibiotic made my heart race so much that i didn't sleep the first night. called my doctor the next day and he changed the medicine because that side effect wasn't one that i could live with.	0
45432	i've been taking 90mg once a week for 6 weeks now. it has helped my depression and quality of life so much. until this last week i have been having back to back anxiety/ panic attacks and i'm not sure what to do about it yet because of the benefits..... does this go away? my chest hurts and i'm basically vibrating now every time it happens....	1
169856	i love this drug. it has worked so well for me. i have recommended it to all of my friends.	1
55822	i been suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder for a few years now and have tried everything under the sun, but with the effexor i am feeling great. it does have some side effects though, but lasted for a few days, but now gone. they include the following: jitters, drowsiness, and a touch of nausea. although with the sadness and anxiety under control i now realize all the physical symptoms of pmdd. i rather have the physical symptoms over the emotions any day.	1
140954	i was on this med for 5 days and decided to stop. i was feeling worse than ever - dopey, sick and with terrible headaches....have been off for 4 days and feel better for it. have decided to try other ways to sort out my anxiety/body pains rather then being drugged to the eyeballs. i could have given it a bit longer but my gut feeling is this drug (like most other ssris) just masks the problem. am now trying claire weekes book &quot;hope and help for your nerves&quot; to get to the bottom of my anxiety. i feel really hopeful, as, deep down, i know it's just my thoughts that are causing my problems. if i can rid myself of anxiety, then my body pains should disappear. here's hoping.	0
97922	i got the nexplanon implant in march of 2015. i chose the implant because unlike every other form of birth control (except the iud), you don't have to remember to do anything. it just sits in your arm and does it's thing. i started bleeding about a week after i got it and have bled every day since march 31. its september 24th today. i have an appointment tomorrow to get it taken out and on something else. the only way that this bc was effective is that i didn't get pregnant (because who wants to have sex when you're always bleeding...). i had high hopes for nexplanon and i really wouldn't recommend that anyone get it.	0
197545	on it's own wellbutrin sr 300mg/day didn't really do much for me. we then added paxil 20mg and klonopin 2mg along with the wellbutrin and i have to say, this is a great combination. the wellbutrin counteracts the sexual side-effects that go along with paxil. wellbutrin by itelf is okay but in combination with paxil and klonopin, helped immensely. highly recommend. my mood is consistenly good, lots of energy. i feel social and light-hearted again. no side effects and i feel great.	1
86875	today is day 3 on latuda. first night i had to take a xanax to go to sleep, day 2 i fell asleep in my own. tonight i still have no symptoms. i'm feeling better after 3 days. i am highly sensitive to medication and was extremely frightened to start it. i'm very happy so far.	1
208585	55 year old male. i've always led a vigorous lifestyle of skiing, biking, kayaking. in the last several years i have had 4 broken ribs, and then earlier this year i broke my right clavicle and then left femur from a fall from a latter. i don't know if its working or not ( no follow up screening yet). my initial t score was -3.9 in the lower lumbar region with various values to -2.9. i have experienced bruising at the injection site, skeletal pain, various stomach issues including constipation, diarrhea, but the latest and worse side affect is a ridged pain in my stomach wall.	0
57735	this medication gave me complete and total relief for the herniated discs in my lower back before the pain turned from acute to chronic. i was on vicodin es before that and when i was having pain at night my orthopedist put me on this and it worked great!	1
188693	i had paragard for over 5 years now and i'm am pretty pleased with it. you do get heavier and longer periods and slight cramping that i use to never get. another side effect that i have noticed but i'm still not 100% sure is the birth control is hair shedding.	1
35470	after two days i started to feel better. the pain in my kidney caused by the infection decreased and disappeared after two days. it is very important that you take the pill at the same time each day and i was late a couple hours, a couple times. overall it worked well for me, with no side effects.	1
846	i was having very frequent urination and some discomfort in my kidneys so i consulted the urologist, he diagnosed me with benign prostatic hyperplasia and no problem in kidneys and prescribed silodal 8 (silodosin capsules 8mg ). after few days the frequency of urination reduced however i am experiencing retrograde ejaculation and not a single drop of semen is released during sex. i am quite scared and concerned about the impact of his drug on my fertility. i am stopping this medicine immediately. i want this serious side effect to be mentioned on the medicine in bold and should be told to all patients who visit the doctor and prescribed with this drug.	0
198619	y'all i had this shot one time last aug and i'm still bleeding! i'm only 23 i want a baby my husband is a marine and we can't even do anything when he is down for time off because i have constantly bled since aug2016!	0
64008	this medication saved my life. in 2015, my depression and anxiety were so horrible. i was sad and/or angry all the time and i was having 1-3 panic attacks a day. i've been suffering with depression since about 4th grade (i'm almost 21 now) but my anxiety didn't really get aggressive until i was a sophomore in high school. after i graduated is when it became a really big problem for me. i stopped taking zoloft in 2015 after a few months because i lost my insurance. i got put back on it in may of 2016. it's been nearly a year and i'm a brand new person. happier, funnier, more full of life, more excited about life, i feel incredible! i only have about 1 panic attack every 2-4 months and my mood is positive and amazing! so happy to have this	1
148949	since i got pregnant with my daughter while i was on the pill and then got pregnant with my son well on the depo shot. i decided to take this iud, it is the worse birth control ever. i'd rather just get pregnant over and over again, i had weight gain, depression lots of pain. since getting it out i have been doing 95% better with my depression, i have no pain, i've lost weight with out trying (6pounds) but i have no period for the last 2 1/2 months with no pregnancy and i had a period while i was on this iud. so don't get it unless you want a messed up body.	0
199463	i was on the depo vera for 4 years. it prevents pregnancy and i didn't have to worry about taking any meds or what not. but if i didn't take the depo right when it was due i would spot like crazy. i decided to stop because it just wasn't normal. i stop taking the depo vera (feb-16-2015) it is now (june-3-2015) i'm still bleeding. my sex life is a wreck me and my boyfriend just deal with it because i will not suffer because of this lol. my advice don't do it. it's horrible and it really messes up your mensual cycle.	0
169603	i had my first migraine and prescribed fiorinal 40 years ago and back then, then they were occasional. as i've gotten older, they are more frequent. this is a problem for my neurologist because fiorinal is on the restricted use list, here in new york. we switched me to fioricet and for three years, that was ok, but then the tylenol started bothering my liver. got a new script for fiorinal and to my surprise, it only comes in capsule form and in my opinion, does not work as well. i hope they will bring back the tablet form. the tablet works the best and i can't understand the need to change to a capsule. why reinvent the wheel?	1
101375	i was on lutera but i changed doctors and he only had aubra so i started taking that and horrible i bleed non stop and it gave me horrible cramps. anytime my boyfriend and i had intercourse it caused me to bleed even more like i had my period again. worst birth control ever didn't agree with me so i went back to my doctor and told him to give me a prescription for lutera and i just got my lutera and started taking it. already i feel better	0
185650	i have been on saxenda since september 26, 2016, today is october 25, 2016 and i just started 3.mg i have lost 20 lbs. i, too, have experienced nausea and headaches after each time i changed the dosage. it takes about two days to calm down. so far so good and hopefully i continue this progress. i started out at 359.8 and as of today i am 339.6	1
169262	i have iritis, so to get rid of the inflamation, i was given ozurdex which caused intense pressure to 40%. the dr. gave me acetazolamide which got rid of the pressure, but caused these insane rashes everywhere on my legs and extreme muscle pain. the loss of appetite is not a big deal to me as well as the tingly toe thing but i have those as well. i've been on this medicine for 2 months and just realized my symptoms are as a result. i seem to be the only one with these crazy side effects so if anyone else has them, please share and tell your dr.	0
125053	i was having problems with some constipation- i chose dulcolax because of the word &quot;gentle&quot; on the box . wrong!!! i took 1 tablet at night and the next morning i was in agony! severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, sweats............. and finally in the middle of all this i managed to have a bm. it is now early evening and i am still having cramps- i have been in bed all day (only get up to go to bathroom)- i will never go for that &quot;gentle relief&quot; again!	0
83151	paxil has helped me out immensely. at first i was really scared to try it because i was reading tons of bad experiences online, but then i decided i needed to do it. well when i first started it i had a few side effects like the speedy feelings, the restlessness, the lack of appetite, and lack of sex drive and orgasm. now i have been on them for 2 months and it is working out so great! i have not had any really bad side effects, and the ones that were there when i first started taking it are gone. this medicine has made my life so much more bearable and worked out great for me!	1
150571	i was originally prescribed levoflaxcin for a bad sinusitus after a week nothing was happening. i was kept on it another week and still nothing. then the doc gave me the sulfmeth tri. i have been bed ridden for 7 days. body aches dizziness, nausea, minor vomiting. i literally feel like i was hit by a train. i have 7 days left but that is it. i'm done. i will not put this crap in my body again. it has been a nightmare.	0
61977	started citalopram two and a half weeks ago for anxiety and stress. first few days felt a little strange, but the anxiety decreased from the first day of taking it. i'm really impressed how much better i've been feeling all around. stupid little things that use to erk me don't have an effect on me anymore. i feel more like i'm living in the moment rather than worrying about the future or things that could happen. i was worried about being a zombie or losing my personality, but i actually feel more outgoing and happy because i'm not nervous and tense. i wanted to share my experience because when my dr. first prescribed it to me, i was to scared to take it. but after reading others reviews i was brave enough to try it and i'm so glad i did!	1
215318	i take the 24mg twice a day after having severe constipation post-chemo and multiple abdominal surgeries. it takes a couple of days for it to cause a movement, but when it does, it's unbelievable how much it works! i have felt the nausea and headaches, but didn't realize it was caused by the amitiza. i'm so thankful to have this medicine!	1
120853	i have been to aa and did not find it effective. please know, i respect anyone in the program. i found myself craving more after meeting and found so many that attended drinking between meetings. i just didn't get it. i have hidden my alcoholism, ashamed, a noticeable binge once a year or so (driving drunk, falling, bad decisions). i thought if i had a successful career and didn't go to jail i was &quot;good at it&quot;. wrong. i found a doctor i could trust and confided everything. he recommended antabuse. i was so scared, i felt like it was going to be a &quot;crutch&quot; and a complete lazy failure. i am so grateful. i feel like it gives me a &quot;beat&quot; in the decision to drink. my &quot;maybe i can drink&quot; has turned into no way!	1
188306	when i first got paragard i was 18, never had children, and had tried a few forms of oral birth control, all of which effected my body terribly. my obgyn advised me not to get it due to the device being rather large in size and that given my age, the insertion would be extremely painful. upon insertion my cramps were excruciating for about a week, then became sporadic for about a month. i also experienced bleeding for three months straight. after those few months however, i had lighter periods, no cramping and everything was wonderful, until about a year later i went in for a ultrasound check up, only to discover the device had disappeared. turns out i'm in the 0.8% to have this happen. apparently it happens in younger women. be cautious.	0
110599	i received the nexplanon in sept. 2014 when the doctor explained to me that he wouldn't be able to tie my tubes. i bleed for three months straight. after i would still bleed i after sex, which lead to a non existing sex life. when that finally stopped i instantly gained about 30 pounds. so i started working out everyday and everyday after working out i would bleed. still no matter what i did i couldn't lose weight. now that the bleeding is gone i still cant lose this weight and i have massive headaches at time. with that said i will be getting mine removed this month. good news i haven't gotten pregnant	0
109006	decided to try nexplanon for something convenient as i am an early 20s medical professional who travels pretty often for work. i have only been on it a few months but i have had no symptoms (besides some headaches and increase in acne the first few weeks). this was the same reaction i had to my pill birth control, but now i don't have to worry about taking the pill or having my period/spotting! so far i love it and recommend it to all my friends!	1
38929	i'm a 29 year old female with no preexisting medical conditions. my doctor recommended contrave for assistance with weight loss. i was originally on the phentermine diet pill but my doctor said that pill wasn't healthy. i was hesitant to use contrave because it was so expensive. i paid $98 for it with a coupon. once i saw that it was the #1 prescribed weight loss pill, i thought it would be worth it. well...i'm 3 weeks in to taking the pill 2x daily with absolutely no weight loss. the first day i was sick as a dog but after that nothing. it has not curbed my appetite at all. i still crave sweets, salty food etc..even more than i did when i was on the phentermine pill which is cheaper. i feel like i wasted my money.	0
150599	didn't do anything for me. i still have severe acne like always. it's been 2 years but no fix. tried doxycycline, minocycline and this. none of them ever worked. i also have super oily skin and this medicine doesn't fix that. it only kills the bacteria, which in my case is not a big problem. oily skin is giving me acne. plus i was applying erythromycin 2% on face. nothing happened. took it for a month. finally going on accutane soon. it was the last resort for me.	0
98330	i had it inserted in nov 2014 i've a period heavy and little everyday it's very stressful and expensive to be buying pads. also, i refuse to have set with my husband knowing that i'm bleeding. very disappointed. i like implanon better at least my periods came every 2-3 months i can deal with that. will be calling my doctor tomorrow	0
134228	i have dealt with an itching face for several months. i was embarrassed for anyone to see my face. after purchasing numerous over the counter creams, without any results, i decided it was time to see the doctor. thank god for prednisone...the itching went away and my skin is clear.	1
120854	i have been to rehab twice in three years. i went to an addictionist and was prescribed antabuse. i didn't get it filled due to the cost &amp; fear of side effects. i made a deal with myself that if i messed up and drank, my &quot;punishment&quot; would be getting it filled. i messed up once, and said ok, that was a mulligan. if i mess up again... which i did. so i got it filled. more than two weeks later, i am still sober! i am taking half pills every 3-4 days, keeping it in my system without it costing so much. zero side effects, except for being sober! someone drank in front of me on thanksgiving. normally i would be rabid to have some as well. with antabuse, i couldn't be bothered to care or crave it.	1
106661	i've literally been bleeding two months and now i'm anemic because of the bleeding , i will never have this implant put in again!	0
101813	yes, yes, yes it worked!!!! i'm happy to report that after only 19-days on terbinafine hcl 250 mg tablets, i woke up this morning to a clear 'pinky' toenail - yay, yay, yay!!! the best part of it all is that i have not experienced any side effects. i'm due for a liver panel test on 2/23/15 and will ask my doctor if can stop taking this med or stay on it for the 90-day treatment.	1
112137	i'm pretty sure i've been taking it for over a year and it's amazing how much it has helped me handle my anxiety! i used to have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks daily but now i never have suicidal thoughts and i only have panic attacks once in a blue moon during my period. i'm sure my anti depression meds and my birth control are definitely helping but i know that without gabapentin my anxiety would be a wreck still. super glad my psychiatrist placed me on it!	1
71824	i was in a car accident 5 years ago and was prescribed tramadol for my chronic back pain. for 2 years i was on dozens of other medications and tramadol was the only medication that worked. i took 50 mg 2 times per day. well 5 years later and i decided to quit the drug. i tapered off the drug myself. i decreased each day by 25 mg. it took 2 weeks but i did it. i can't believe it. there were some nights when i would get jittery but i took amitryptiline to help me sleep. i feel amazing now. so much better. i have my energy back and i take tylenol for pain.	1
146580	had pain left side. cat scan showed 6mm stone in ureter. started flomax twice daily and drank lots of water with lemon juice. started flomax on monday night. passed stone on friday morning. no pain. never needed lortabs. i have had kidney stone surgery twice. to be able to pass a 6mm stone with no surgery and no pain is wonderful. $12 versus $30,000.	1
137971	in my personal experience this was horrible. been on it for 3 days and just took it off tonight because i can't handle it anymore. i am puking all night (10-12 times) and can't hold anything down. i am having body aches and can't stop shaking. and also a massive headache that advil won't get rid off. it works for alot of people, i guess just not for me.	0
90515	used it for 9 days straight. it didn't even touch it. why doesn't anything ever work as advertised. :o/	0
138248	i had my first series of three shots in 2015. what a relief i received from them. i am bone on bone with 2 spurs in my left knee. my first set of shots lasted almost 20 months with little pain. i just completed my 2nd series of 3 shots and the knee is already feeling better. my doctor said that about half of the people get relief with the shots, but i feel it is worth a shot to see if you in that 50% who get relief.	1
52746	after many medications and several diagnosis, just after once day since i was put on this medication i feel like part of my life is regained.	1
67739	this medication was always my go to when i had unprotected sex and it always worked for me. just always remember, the sooner you take it the better. i had unprotected sex, my boyfriend came inside me twice, and i bought the pill the following morning 12 hours after sex. this pill always works for me but side effects that i have experienced are lightheadedness, extreme hunger, and often, a late period. i know some of you worry and that's why you're here but honestly, with this pill, the chance of getting pregnant after taking this pill is slim ! just let the pill do its thing!	1
207288	i have been getting cold sores since i was 9 years old, sadly when i was little they didn't know what cold sores were and how contagious they were. therefore they were spread much more often than today. they are miserable, not only are they very painful, it's hard to eat as well but they are very very embarrassing. people look at you like you have the plaque. i used to suffer for 2 weeks during an outbreak but now i take valtrex at the first sign and if i catch it fast enough i don't even get the cold sore. if not then it's pretty much gone in 3 days. it doesn't get near as big or as painful and it's much easier to hide. i love this medication and can't say enough good things about it. try it you won't be disappointed.	1
220244	i had irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhea for around 8 years. after gp tried everything, as a last resort i was prescribed 5mg before bed. the very next morning i was amazed at the difference. it also helped greatly with sleep. after 3 days i took it every other day, then after another week every 2-3 days, and so on. after 6 weeks i didn't need to take it continuously anymore. only the occasional times when it flared up during the next year or so. 18 months later i was free of the problems and had to dispose of the remaining prescription! it's very underrated from what i have read.	1
36097	i appreciate this drug because provided the bcc isn't too deep or on the lips, it can save surgery and scarring. since my dad ended up looking like a patchwork quilt, i am very grateful for the surgeries saved. i only once has a bad reaction, and that was with a large, deep bcc on my back. on more now for face and arm and so far not so bad. i just think of it as weed killing.	1
71787	i was given tramadol for my knee pain. what a joke. it did absolutely nothing for my pain. the dr. wouldn't give me anything else, so i just suffer with it.	0
90525	abreva used to work for me, but the last couple of times i've used it.. it seemed liked it didn't do anything to help supress the sore.. this time my sore keeps getting bigger and bigger! i started applying as soon as i felt the sore coming on and it just didn't help at all! same thing the last time.	0
12730	was on enbrel for seven years, got relief after first injection. i developed breast cancer this year and feel that enbrel played a part in bringing it on. i wouldn't change a thing though, i would have been crippled by now, i had good years enjoying life while on enbrel. i can no longer take enbrel, and my ra has gotten so much worse. also taking prednisone, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate.	1
96023	i've been taking zoloft for 3 days on a doctors recommendation and don`t notice any of the the benefits yet. i have felt a whole bunch of side effects including nausea, loss of appetite, drowsiness and diarrhea. i'll be seeing the doctor in two days and from what i understand these side effects should decrease over time.	0
211891	i've battled depression for 10 years plus im on 40 mg citalopram and have been on this for 8 years. 2 year's ago i was put on quetiapine brilliant results but horrid side affect then my consultant put me on 300 mg (slowy increased) lamotrigine same result and no side affects i noticed results within the first week and progression carried on for a good wile i feel a normal member of the human race again. i still have little episodes but are managible i am very happy with this drug its changed me for the better.	1
110971	this is my 4th pregnancy. i've always had bad morning sickness with each pregnancy but always ended by my 10th week. i started the rx at 7 weeks and tried stopping at 13 weeks but experience terrible withdrawal symptoms. i only take 1 pill at night. when i tried stopping the med, i violently throw up, nauseous all day, body aches and excessive sweating. i would have never started the prescription if i knew stopping it is this painful.	0
173563	easy to take, inexpensive, and no side effects. has a moderately positive impact by lessening frequency (2-5 fewer attacks) and severity (average intensity brought down from 7 to 5).	1
169369	i am on this medication and so far it's working perfectly! it does suppress my appetite a lot! every time i eat and the first bite of food hits my stomach i get sick and feel like i am going to throw up, so it's working and is deterring me from over eating! i didn't rank it a full 10 because the price is sort of high (depends on where you buy it) however, i have found that wal-mart is the cheapest on it!	1
66304	i was supposed to take this for supressive therapy, but i stopped after my outbreak because i couldn't stand the side effects. this pill made me dizzy and i could hardly function at work. i don't know if this or the hsv 1 is worse.	0
75796	since the beginning of this year (2015) i have been experiencing bouts of insomnia at an increasing rate. first just a night or two once a month to a week or so once a month. my doc prescribed temazepam 30 mg at bedtime. i took it and it worked like a charm but when i wouldn't take it i'd be back to insomnia all night long. after a month of taking it every night i began sleep walking. i would get out of bed and go to various rooms in the house and sometimes wake up and be confused. i tried to quit it but i was a total wreck that day, high anxiety, heavy pulse, elevated blood pressure almost like a panic attack. it's a controlled substance. i am off it now. nasty stuff it forces you to sleep. i am going to try elavil and see how that works.	0
219120	subutex took me off the street and helped me to be able to manage my life and het on the right path, just wondering if anyone else has had ankle/feet swelling since starting it? thanks yall and good luck!	1
201867	for years i was on no drugs for type 2 diabetes, only diet. my a1c test were always around 6.1, and then my dr put me on januvia. my sugars are now averaging 15.7. the dr has just upped my dose to 1-1/2 pills of januvia and added diaformin. why?? from good control with no pills to out of control in 4 months. i'm really starting to doubt the doctors motives.	0
98471	i got the nexplanon in august, 2 months after having my 2nd son. i had my period september but for 3 weeks! i hated that part. it is now october and i haven't had my period. i am going to take a pregnancy test, just in case. but i hope it's just the birth control causing me not to have started yet. other than that i love this form of birth control and will definitely get it again. i did have hives and still get them but its nothing manageable and not enough to give it a bad rap.	1
92497	pregnant in 1994, i was the first person in scotland to take this medicine, injected, and it saved my life and that of my unborn child, scared and feeling at a loss it worked wonders. i was so thin, dangerously thin, dangerously ill, what a turn around in the space of one week. first thing i ate in 7 months came thanks to zofran. i would recommend this to anyone who is suffering severe hyperemesis during pregnancy and not to worry, it worked out fine for me and my child who is now 19 and has an amazing life thanks to ondansetron (zofran).	1
183595	this medication is very difficult to get off of. i recently began taking tamoxifen for breast cancer, only to find out that cymbalta blocks the metabolism of it, and i should come off it. easier said than done.	0
96899	have recently started back on qvar after having stopped due to gastritis which was probably caused by beta-blocker/aspirin and 2bd blood thinner, for my heart attack which turned out not to be one in the first instance but remained on these meds for months until mri confirmed otherwise - myocarditis. respiratory specialist states 60% fine mist particles lodge in the lungs with qvar, the other 40% probably into my gut which is causing me nausea plus headaches and fungal infected fingers (2). am back to trying an evening one single dose through spacer, rinsing mouth and hoping i my body will adapt to these side effects. has anyone got any suggestions or thoughts? i'm immune suppressed with pmr 18+ months on steroids, now tapering.	0
97106	very happy with ambien. i've used a half tablet on and off for about two years. it really helps me relax and fall asleep. which can be really hard when you are taking six college courses. just make sure you take it right as you fall asleep. and do not up your dosage if you feel you are building a &quot;tolerance&quot;.	1
61889	i was originally prescribed this for major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. at 20mg it didn't help at all, but once raised to 40mg and combined with an anti-psychotic (to prevent manic episodes) it worked well for 5 - 6 months. unfortunately it stopped working completely, quite out of the blue, and neither myself, other half or medical professionals could figure out why. it was a shame as i had virtually no side-effects on this medication, just some 'bruxing' (teeth grinding) at night, but not to the point where my jaw ached or anything.	1
110974	the first time i took it, i took one pill upon waking up. i literally stayed in bed the entire day. i could hardly open my eyes, let alone lift my head off the pillow. thank goodness it was a weekend and i didn't have to work! i chalked it up to a bad morning sickness day and took two at bedtime that night. the next morning, it wasn't quite as bad but it was still a struggle to get through the day. i wasn't nauseous, but i was so fatigued and sleepy, and just felt &quot;bad.&quot; i realized it might be the diclegis, so i didn't take any more after that. so now i'm back to all-day nausea (no vomiting), but at least i can function! i only recommend diclegis if you've got major vomiting/hg. otherwise, the side effects just aren't worth it.	0
48749	i've been on chateal for around 6 months now, i was originally taking lzya which wasn't working out for me with abnormal bleeding, but since taking chateal i've had no issues. i think it's very effective as a birth control, no weight gain, i don't think it's effected my mood at all either, sex drive is fine, and its even pretty good with controlling acne, i'm pretty happy with it and like it a lot more than what i was taking before	1
107899	i have been on this for over 8 years. it was my first and only birth control brand. made my breasts swell and hurt for a couple months and then that completely went away. i had no other side effects. by this point my periods are so light i will do 4-6 patches before removing it (yes, you can do this with the patch!). i highly recommend this. i put the patch on a butt cheek and alternate sides each week.	1
228136	i've had implanon for 3 1/2 months and am very pleased with it. since it was inserted, i&rsquo;ve experienced slight spotting, but have never had to use anything more than a panty liner. there have been a few negative side effects (heart burn, some headaches, and slight pain at the insertion sight), but the ease of not having to take a pill everyday far outweighs those slight annoyances. originally, i was scared to try implanon, because i had read a lot of negative reviews. in the end, i am happy i chose it and would definitely recommend it to others.	1
178992	i have been on 0.6 victoza for the last 7 days. i have had no side effects whatsoever, except for maybe less of an appetite. i have already lost 7 lbs so far, a pound a day! and my blood sugar readings have gone from 170's to 109. this is a miracle. i only hope that the side effects don't get worse or grow in number. moving to 1.2 tomorrow. we shall see how things go from there.	1
153332	i had high hopes for this drug. but sadly all it doesn't work so well for me. arrrg my skin hurts so bad!!! it literally feels like its burning. my skin has become so dry that its starting to peel. i try putting on cream but that hurts soooooo bad. it literally feels like my skin is on fire when i try to moisturize. my doc gave me a cream and even that freaken hurts so bad!!!	0
120134	i have been on this medicine since early spring, so probably about 4 months straight now, for my severe allergies and it has helped with them. however, i have noticed some major mood swings and depression. i started getting dark thoughts (regarding only myself), and i will sit in a ball and cry for hours and worry about the dumbest things. it's been giving me anxiety attacks which i have never had before. it is horrible. i am glad that i am not going crazy. i see that unfortunately other people are reacting the same way. last night was my last time taking the med. i hope it gets out of my body fast!!!! don't take this medicine!!	0
105119	i have inherited familial high cholesterol. at age 36, i had quintuple by-pass surgery. at age 46, 56, 63 and 65, i had stents due to blockages. i've been taking statins for 30 years in spite of severe muscle pain, currently crestor and started rapatha injections every two weeks, shortly after it became available. i consider the shortness of breath i have been experiencing to the rapatha, and my symptoms have grown increasingly worse during this period of time, including weakness and trouble breathing. i have allergies and asthma, which i thought was the source of my trouble breathing, however, my breathing problems have significantly worsened since taking rapatha and is a debilitating side effect. cholesterol has dropped significantly.	1
136959	i tried so many acne medications, but none of them did the job as well as accutane. it's been about 6 months since i finished my cycle and i haven't had a problem with acne since. i had bad cystic acne that i hated and it made me never want to go out or do anything for fear of people seeing how bad my face was. initially i was scared of using the medication because of all the side effects, but they were really not bad and i survived it with barely any issues except the dry skin. your acne will get a bit worse before it gets better so be patient and stick with it.	1
126513	i was given a sample by my dermatologist and decided to give mirvaso a try for a couple of weeks before purchasing. after a week i noticed that my facial skin would start tingling, then turn bright red! it has now been 4 days since i discontinued using the product and fortunately the brightness is finally starting to fade back to where it was before i started using this product. the episodes of tingling skin have occured less and less frequently. bummed that the product did not work!	0
176577	this medication worked for my anxiety but made me a complete zombie. i would forget things i was doing and just had a drowsy i don't care attitude. it got rid of my anxiety but interrupted my daily work routine because i couldn't think to function. i would only recommend if you are having extreme jump out of your skin anxiety, otherwise try to do things naturally. i started taking vitamins and working out regularly and my anxiety has gone down at least 60%.	0
134555	so far, has helped a nasty frozen shoulder! pain free for a few days. nothing took away the pain except for this. felt like i have had child-labor-pain in my arm for the last five months. nice!!	1
217737	i was prescribed strattera for add 40 mg. and i was only on it for 6 days. i was warned about the side effect of having nausea and to eat before taking meds in the morning. i started strattera on a saturday morning and by that night i had diarrhea so bad that i thought i would have to sleep sitting on the toilet, i also had the feelings of being constantly angry, i had really bad headaches, depression, tireness, it worsened my anxiety and any time i would eat i ended up on the toilet for quite a while. i was put on strattera to help me with my add lack of concentration, etc, needless to say, it didn't work what so ever. my poor butt thanked me when i quit taking it, hahaha.	0
143303	i have had the nexplanon for 5 months now. i hate it &amp; would not recommend it! i was on bc pills for 3 years, but decided to try something different because the pills tend to give me headaches. i have a scar on my arm from the insert &amp; it's very tender in that area of my arm. i have my cycle 3 weeks out of the month. i was told that my body would have to get use to the nexplanon but after 3 months everything should be normal. that is not the case! i have gained 10 lbs so far, no sex drive &amp; i am depressed normally all of the time. this was not me before getting the nexplanon!! i have decided to have it removed &amp; will have my consultation tomorrow. i cannot wait to get back to my bc pills. i rated this a 3 only bc i haven't gotten pregnant.	0
161846	symptoms of prostatitis will go away, but the side effects are no joke. i started my cycle after finding all of the reviews online. after 4 doses of 2 week supply i called the nurse practitioner who wrote the script and told her i'm done. if you research online you'll find that cipro is one of the big guns in anti biotics, so if your primary suggest it to you right off the bat, ask for options.	0
73079	ive been taking it for a year now, works great for me. i can only do the pill because my body reacts so strangly to most but this has cause no problems for me. my mood is normal, weight is the same. i'd tell others to give it a chance	1
121707	i love it. i get dizzy and almost black out when i hop up. so i learned to get up slow. my pain has turned dull now instead of sharp and menacing like it's been for almost 5 yrs. taking this with oxycodone and robaxin helps me get through each day. still not well enough where i can exercise due to horrible muscle inflammation. started on the 25mg...moved to 75mg...now i'm taking the 150mg xr and i can say that i think i should stay here.	1
32582	becomes ineffective after sometime. one of the side effects is extreme swelling which is very unfortunate.	0
116272	been on humira for 6 months, had 14 injections. it hasn't helped my uc symptoms at all. the injections burned really bad for several hours. then the skin around the injection site become red, raised, and very warm to the touch. the patch became bigger and bigger after each injection. i have been more tired than i've ever been before, and barely have any energy to do anything but go to work. over the few months, i've had a few incidents of cold-like symptoms; fever, sweating, chills, that lasted sometimes more than two days. as for my uc symptoms, there's been no change, and they possibly even got worse. on a typical day, i have 10-15 bathroom trips. on a bad day, 20 .	0
4814	i am a 52 year old male. i started belviq on 1/20/15. i started at 231lbs. my main problem was no willpower and a love of food. while belviq did not get rid of my hunger, it brought it within my &quot;willpower zone&quot;. assisted by a calorie counter app i have lost 25 lbs in 44 days. there were no adverse effects for me. i exercise 3x a week and really eat whatever i want, as long as i stay under my calorie target for the day. belviq has given me the head start i needed to live a more healthy life.	1
215249	i take 8 mg, 2 pills a day; 1 teaspoon of milk of magnesia at night; worked great for a month, then stopped. i am either not going or runny stools; terrible gas and bloating; affecting my entire life; i take gas-x and charcoal tablets daily; no real consistent relief but runny stools is better than nothing for me; no nausea with food.	0
33744	worst birth control i have ever taken. went on it to regulate my period and stop my horrible cramps. yes it did the job but gave me massive anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. was on it for about a month and a half and stopped immediately. my sex drive completely disappeared and still took a while to come back after i stopped taking this pill. i was moody 24/7 and not in a good mental state. worst stuff i have ever taken.	0
114628	don't think it did much for the cough. made me nauseated. fell asleep for awhile and was kind of awake and was hearing voices than i had some creepy dreams. probably the last time i try this...	0
93517	bring back avinza! i've had a c1-c2 chronic pain for 36 years now. the closest i have come to how things were before some illegal drunk in an 18-wheeler truck was allowed to kill two friends, change another friend's life, &amp; ruin my life, has been avinza. it's been a year &amp; my life again turned upside down, as i have yet to find another morphine that compares to avinza. of course i am refused to try ms- contin, or oxy-contin, even though i've taken narcotics responsibly now for almost 25 years. just bring back avinza, as i know there has to be other people like me, though i fear from experience- that we who suffer from chronic pain, are looked at as irrelevant, and why avinza was taken away from us!	1
210041	i started 145mcg dosage and have been on one a day for the last five days. i'm now stopping this medication and will never take it again. it helped a little the first couple days, however, the lower abdominal pain is just too intense and.. i have a terrible terrible headache that i cannot get rid of , plus the sneezing started and i have awful cold/sinus symptoms.. i feel so incredibly sick.. stopping it and praying these side effects subside asap:(... there a more natural ways to help with my issues and this medicine is just no good..	0
185589	i wrote a review previously after a few days of taking saxenda. i am now on my 4th week (2.4mg) and so far i have lost 18lbs! i am so happy. this is based on minimal exercise and just eating healthily. as many people have said, it does curb your appetite. i could normally eat a full plate but now by body let's me know when i am &quot;full&quot; and i can literally not eat more than half a plate. any more than that and i will start to feel sick. i also stay away from fatty foods; again trying to eat this will also make me feel sick afterwards, so i have been on grilled salmon and vegetables most nights for dinner. i get incredibly thirsty so i have a litre water bottle with me everywhere i go. this also helps me feel less hungry.	1
50325	pain relief is limited and barely noticed. i take 1800 mg a day and still need 6 percocet per day to get enough relief to function. i've tried to stop the gabapentin and couldn't do it without withdrawals. i have forgotten to take medicines with me while out for a long day and also had withdrawal symptoms which include severe stomach pain and diarrhea.	0
215112	very satisfied. does what it claims to do and i don't feel any side effects.	1
40083	i've been on contrave for four weeks now and i'm really starting to see the weight loss. i too experienced the nausea, but it was only after the dosage was upped and only for a day or so. not only does it make me not snack, but i've noticed i'm starting to get less interested in food in general (yes, i'm still eating plenty). one thing for sure, you do still have to stay on a diet while on contrave.	1
156651	i have no appetite and i do have nausea. i have lost 11 pounds this month. i did miss 1 week of work because i had no energy and felt like i had the flu.	1
11050	i was prescribed terbinafine for a tinea versicolor rash across my back and shoulders. it wasn't very noticeable, but it irritated me in a cosmetic sense. my doctor put me on a two month terbinafine plan. i have taken the medicine once a day orally for about three weeks. as soon as i started taking it, i felt itchy all the time and urinated more than usual. then one monday morning, i woke up covered in hot, itchy hives everywhere. it's been three days now, the hives are still there, my upper and lower eyelids are swollen and my hands and feet are swollen to the point of pain. i'd imagine i'm allergic.	0
192083	worst experience of an entire 4 weeks! this was the first time i took an oral contraceptive and i regret it. i've had terrible mood swings. one minute i'm fine, then the next i'm arguing and angry with everyone and everything. i've also gained weight. sex life hasn't been disrupted, however being deeply depressed ruins it anyways. i'm usually happy and alert, however on zarah i've been tires and sleepy. can't wait to finally stop this and try another brand.	0
117136	i can't praise this drug highly enough. at the age of 59, i'm finally leading a level life - without quiting jobs in a rage, moving my family 1,400 miles to a house i'd never seen. due to troubles with sleeping, i also take seroquel.	1
208559	after trying multiple medicines for high blood pressure over the course of 10 years i was given a prescription for azor and saw improvements almost immediately. before azor my bp was average 160-175/120, with azor i am consistently 117/76-80.	1
165769	got kyleena inserted two weeks ago. i just want to clarify- the insertion is painless. it took less than two minutes. if you have a good doctor, he or she will warn you when you're about to cramp so you can expect it. yes there are two big cramps that you feel because they're dilating you and putting something up there. i was fine after, walked around, went shopping, etc. now two weeks later i'm experiencing severe cramps that are almost like painful contractions. also having light brown bleeding..will stick it out though, this birth control is brainless my body just has to get used to it.	1
90815	works better than 5mg oxycodone. i do not feel that the 5/325 norco works at all but the 10/325 does help. some people can &amp; will get an upset stomach when taking it. all you have to do is ask for some nausea medication to go with it. i think it is a bit rediculous that it is so hard to get, especially when you are in extreme pain. i honestly feel that it helps with my fibromyalgia pain as well, not fully but it does help.	1
16682	i have been on yaz for about three years now and i love it. i have experienced great decrease in my pms. i was a monster before starting yaz and now i'm normal with occasional periods having slight mood swings or cramps. my boobs have grown and my acne has subsided. i get a few pimples every now and then commonly when my period comes. i do get some bloating but if i take something like midol then i have none. i'm able to know exactly when my period starts. i have only experienced one occurrence in 3 years of using yaz, of spotting when not missing a pill. i haven't noticed any weight gain due to the pill. the only thing i am worried about is the scare of blood clotting lately.	1
213952	fire in the hole! in my opinion to use this product you have to be a sadist or a pysco. i'm on a strong course of antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection and as a present i got a yeast infection as an result. i decided to use the 1 day treatment to just get it over with and it may be the worst decesion of my life. within moments after i administered the treatment i began with an intense burning and itching sensation that was worst than the infection's symptoms. i just hit a home run with my shower head to try and alleviate the discomfort and rid myself of the devil cream. i would not recommend nor ever use again. user beware!	0
88149	tooth infection. after taking 5 of the 28 pills i had the worst heartburn of my life and could not even lay down. after 10 of them i ended up in the er with chest pains, excruciating heartburn, diarrhea, and the itchiest hives from head to toe. they were however very effective at clearing up the infection which in turn reduced the pain in my mouth significantly. so for me, where tooth pain is almost intolerable it was a trade off i accept.	0
116937	have been taking it for 2 years. stopped my seriously depressed moods 100%. my hyper moods as well, although did not have these as often. i was severely depressed and couldn't go to work, angry, and my mind was spinning all night. this was going on for years. i never realized it could have been a chemical imbalance until i &quot;flipped&quot; from giving up on life, to &quot;everything is great! what was i thinking!&quot; then back to giving up again within 3 hours. lamictal has made all of this stop. it's wonderful to be &quot;normal&quot; again.	1
188501	i'm 20 with no kids and thought paragard would be the best option since i don't do well with hormones. i usually take pain pretty well but this hurt so bad. even though it was only for a couple minutes, it was the worst pain i've ever felt down there. my doctor put it in and i had an ultrasound right after to make sure it was in the right place. of course the arms didn't open up, and the iud had to be taken out and another one needed to be put it in. it was horrible!! the second one was even worse than the first and took about 8 minutes to get in correctly. a month later i had another ultrasound and the iud had moved into my cervix and needed to be taken out. i really wanted this to work. i'm now looking into skyla.	0
48808	i've been taking aviane for about a year. cleared up my acne within a month or two; i don't get any cystic acne anymore. it's a relief. i don't get any side effects and it definitely evens out my mood.	1
174228	like others have said, it's a foam but it's sticky like glue. it's helps a little bit in keeping flare ups at bay and it may get rid of some very small spots, but it's not going to do much for any large inflamed patches.	0
17276	i get constipation every time i start a new cycle. i am nauseous when i take the medicine. i take ginger pills twice a day and drink ginger ale. this helps with nausea. my dosage has dropped 1500 units to 1000 units after 6 treatments.	1
201464	i started having panic attacks when i was 20. the docs put me on zoloft and it helped me tremendously. not only that, i stopped being the shy person that i had been prior to that. however i stopped taking it after a year because i figured i had been cured. i spent years after that without any anxiety until i had a severe bout of ocd at the age of 27 which was threatening to really destroy my life. i resisted taking medication for 2 years which was such a stupid idea. i don't know why i chose to suffer even though i knew zoloft would help me again. anyhow, i went back on zoloft and poof! problem solved. but then i quit again and now after many years that i tried going back on it its not working as much. i wish i had stayed on it :(	1
229038	i am diabetic also long time smoker who quit 5 years ago. sex hasnt been right for a while. got a prescription for 20mg tabs. read about the side effects and decided to try cutting the pill in thirds. had sex three hours later. amazing! like being 20 again. tiny headache for an hour the next day. seems to be working fine on the third day.	1
65084	i started taking this med for hbp. i notice after i take it, my bp goes up and my pulse drops, i feel dizzy. i don't like it. my doc said to keep taking it, but i'm not so sure i should. has this happened to anyone else?	0
38747	well i've been taking this med for a little over a month now. i will say the first night i took it i did suffer insomnia but only for one night. now that i'm on the full dosage for about 2 weeks now i am noticing more of a nausea feeling for the past few days. i've lost about 13lbs so it does works for me. however i don't believe i'll be taking for too much longer due to the nausea feeling. fyi - if you eat any grease or fried foods you will definitely feel the affects. it does force you to think about what you are eating and how it affects you.	1
224058	i was being plagued by severe coughing attacks which in turn would cause my lower back to go in spasms. i was on a steady does of valium and percocet for about two months. my body became tolerant to that combination, i talked to my doctor and he suggested soma compound. it's been like night and day. i don't think chemically it's as strong as the percocet/valium combination, but the soma was just what i needed. i didn't have any (that i can think of) side-effects from taking it. it was not nearly as addicting as percocet and i'm able to always keep them on me for backup now and never feel the need to use for the heck of it. for me, there was no high associated with the soma. amazing!	1
67392	i have been using vimpat since 2011. i found a new doctor in 2011 he ordered vimpat 100mg 2x a day, along with clonezapam .05 2x a day, somehow this was the perfect combination of both medicines as i have been seizure free for 5 years! vimpat works for me! :-)	1
22208	baclofen gave me terrible dream/nightmares and i would &quot;walk in my sleep&quot; during them, that is, getting out of my bed and literally trashing my bedroom, knocking everything off the nightstand, flipping over my computer chair, tried to crawl under a tv tray... crazy stuff, that i never did before. as soon as i quit the baclofen (thinking that must be it), those dreams never happened again. ps, since baclofen did this to me, they tried rx tizanidine/zanaflex, and i had the same reaction from those so i just don't have a muscle relaxer anymore.	0
93705	it worked wonders for my back for 5 years and then my back became a lot worse. i am now up at mayo clinic to see what they will do now as i was told that i am inoperable.	1
115	i have had 2 injections and am discontinuing the drug after 6 months. in my opinion it is just not worth it. i experienced extreme nausea for 2 or 3 days within the first 3 months of getting the injection. my periods came early and lasted 2 week. i had many anxiety episodes and mood swings. nearing the time of my second injection i experienced extremely heavy bleeding for 5 days, (i'm talking new super tampons every 2 hours with a regular pad for inevitable leaks) and even fainted during this time. 6 months later and most of my symptoms have gone, but i've had my period since my second injection over 3 months ago. at least it has been effective in preventing pregnancy; the combination of these symptoms leave me with no desire for sex!	0
194901	i'm 55/ male and recently experienced a seizure during a visit at an md clinic upon falling from the cart i was on and striking my head, i then had a subsequent episode two weeks later. i was started on keppra 500mg twice daily, it has now been almost a week and since starting my appetite has tanked, i have had profound anxiety attacks,and insomnia along with occasional emotional lability, also ataxia when walking. don't know if i wanted to continue this, but will speak with my neurologist next week.	0
137059	excellent drug, most side effects i experienced were dose related and a reduced dose made the drug tolerable. i experienced disturbing depression at higher doses but was able to ameliorate this by reducing the dose and extending the treatment period. i needed 2 courses of treatment. overall results excellent.	1
46838	this was a terrible experience. the pharmacist warned me of the side affects but i just thought it would not affect me as other medicines have not. this stuff gave me diarrhea, cramps, and nauseous. my doctor had instructed me to take it for 7 days. after 1.5 days i could not stomach this. i called him and he told me not to take any more of this medicine.	0
171296	i felt levitra was amazing!! i had mild erectile dysfunction (ed). a 10mg dose was probably more than i needed, the benefit was 12-16 hrs. i'm 48, 5'10&quot; 160lbs, good shape, no other medical problems. the product took effect in minutes!! even if you have mild ed, see your doctor and try levitra. you won't believe the results.	1
72426	i've been in this bc since late aug. i sadly had to have with a medical abortion 4 1/2 months in due to health problems. i started another bc 7 days after my procedure, but i wanted to switch back to my old bc (lo lo) when i finished the 1st pack of the other bc. i've had periods and the only bc related side affect has been tender breasts, which has only started recently. i was nervous i may be pregnant again (i am still recovering from the damage and severe weight loss caused by the pregnancy), but she reassured me it is normal to not have periods. she said during the procedure, they scraped my uterus lining clean, so i started with no lining &amp; the bc didn't have to break anything down. i have been emotional, but i'm happy w/ the progress	1
19882	can't even explain how bad this made me feel. seriously thought i was dying. chills...sweating ...throwing up...i actually passed out on my bathroom bath. my chest pain was so bad i thought i was having a heart attack. no desire to eat...i've never had a problem with meds like this before in my life. never again. i took it for 2 days and stopped. be cautious.	0
145872	i am 23 years old and i started at 242 pounds. after many attempts with weight watchers, exercise programs, and boxed meal plans i decided it was time to seek help from the doctor, i felt terrible all the time. i was diagnosed as a pre-diabetic and the endocrinologist prescribed this for me. i have been on this medication about a week. i have already lost around 4-5 pounds, i feel better. the only thing i have had trouble with is sometimes i will go most of the day without eating and get a headache from it. my portions have shrunk with ease and i don't feel hungry or want to eat all the time. also the website for qsymia was able to help me with the first month of this since my insurance will not cover it for $75.	1
90542	idk why i continue to waste my money trying abreva. i put it on at the first sign of a cold sore. and i've been applying it as recommended, well. my cold sore is still progressing at the same rate that it would have i not used abreva. its too expensive. i won't try it again.	0
79639	i have been on lantus for over 3 weeks and i feel i have less control of my sugar levels. i take 22 units at bedtime, and it isnt lowering my levels like it should. per doctor, i cannot take regular insulin with it as the lantus is a 24 hr dose. so if my level spikes to sway 435, i can't take a shot of regular insulin to bring it down, i have to ride it out till bedtime when i can take another does of lantus. i would rather take regular insulin every 6 hrs than do the lantus, as it gives me more control of the dose i need for my sugar levels.	0
27642	i have been experiencing motion sickness every time i travel by plane and decided to give this a try. not only did i not experience any nausea, but it knocked me out for my two hour flight! i fell asleep while people were still boarding and woke up when the plane hit the ground again. amazing!	1
195260	everything comes with a price. works very well for prostate enlargement, but the side effects are very much there.	0
120834	this drug literally saved my life. i had a routine where after work everyday i would go to the liquor store, get a 40oz and knock it back, before heading to the bar. i did this for years. when i finally hit a wall (it's a long story) i saw a few different healthcare professionals, one of whom was a psychiatrist and he prescribed me antabuse. he explained it to me very well, and asked me if i would try it and i agreed. the thing about it is, this drug forces you to change your habits. it gives you the time you need to think things through and make different decisions. while i was taking antabuse i had to take the time and thought required to figure out other things to do with my time. it was a process. it worked. sober 9yrs.	1
83684	this medicine works great. i had mild diarreah as a side effect, but my annoying mucus cough was relieved.	1
25310	occupational health at my workplace prescribed this patch for me because i apparently strained a muscle below my patellar bone... it did nothing for me! apparently it works for everyone else, so i may just be an oddball. it was like taking a placebo and i am not even taking other pain meds... so it's not like i have a tolerance level for pain meds... this just doesn't do anything for me. it was def. a miss.	0
34292	34 y/o female on hbp meds since severe bacterial infection wiped out 3/4 of kidney function 5 years ago. had been on 100mg/day of metoprolol and it caused mind-numbing fatigue and fogginess, and frankly i realize now i was over-medicated. doc switched me to 5mg/day bystolic and i felt like a new woman overnight! no fatigue and only noticeable side effect (like someone else mentioned) was that it knocked back my libido some, which wasn't a terrible thing and isn't affecting me that much. i can get through a work day without taking a nap at lunch and actually have a life after hours now. i'm glad i took a chance on this med!	1
224807	this did nothing for me, as far as i'm concerned, i think its a placebo.. i was very depressed because i felt awful everyday, i could barely get out of bed, i felt exhausted, foggy mind, body ached, and long list of other debilitating symptoms.. i knew i wasn't just feeling these things physically for no reason. i'm only 30yrs old and when i started having memory problems i knew that it wasn't just depression!! my primary doc did blood work and found i had some severe vitamin deficiencies! i got some prescription vitamins and changed my diet.. i feel better physically and mentally!! this may not help everyone but i encourage you to make sure your doc does a lot of tests tests to rule out others health issues before before blaming depression	0
95957	after suffering a bereavement and going through menopause i suffered anxiety attacks. i continuously felt stressed - had the shakes when i woke up, and heart palpitations ...all in all life was bad. eventually i asked my dr for help. he prescribed sertraline ( one week 25g second week 50g). the first 2 weeks i felt as though they weren't making any difference, but after the third week the shakes and palpitations stopped. now nearly three months later i feel so much better in every way. i sleep better ..enjoy my life again. i would recommend that anyone trying sertraline not to give up after the first two weeks if you don't feel any benefit, it does take a while to get into your system. as for side effects, i haven't had any.	1
144355	i used nuva ring in the past and it worked very well, the only reason why i decided to try nexplanon was because i was moving to europe for a study abroad program and wanted to avoid having to get a new prescription to get nuva ring and have to go thorough another doctor in europe etc... i have the implant since september 2015, at first it was ok i just had a minor bruise that lasted about a week and that was it, no pain, as a matter of fact it was too good to be true. the first month i did not have my period eveyrthing was going so well until the second month, i start spotting then bleeding then spotting again, it felt like i had a period since then, i start having acne like i never before. 8 month later i can't wait to take this thing out	0
209517	it is great for opiate addiction withdrawal. and to stay off opiates. you do not have withdrawal and do not feel the opiate high while taking. i took suboxone for 6 years and zubsolv for 2. i have been off all for just over 3 weeks and finally starting to feel normal. i do have to tell you it can get your life back together but at some point you will want to stop. withdrawal is just as bad stopping zubsolv as opiates. the first 9 days for me were horrible. and i knew what i was in for. not to discourage anyone. but hang in there it will get better. you may feel like time has stopped for a couple weeks but for what its worth you'll be free and clean.	1
224778	legs shaking to the point i was unable to walk	0
39742	started 12/18/15. female 221lbs 5'6 42 yrs old 1st day took 1 pill at 7:30am was sick all day stayed in bed. day 2 1 pill 7:30am tried to do my normal daily routine was so sick. so i have stopped til after the holidays i have to much to do. my side effects are nausea, headache, sweats,dizziness , i could feel my heart beat speed up. i really want this to work. i have tried so many things over the last 6yrs and nothing works i was doing a workout plan for a 3 days a week for entire year lost only 5 lbs with 1000 calorie a day.	0
179081	i initially started on 5 mg and after 2 weeks my doctor put me on 10 mg. i feel fantastic. my mind doesn't race anymore and i'm finally sleeping all night long. short lived groggy feeling in morning, i make myself get up and move, that seems to work the best. the suicidal thoughts are gone and i just feel really good. no weight gain yet but i do exercise 3-4 times a week. only noticeable side affect is i seem to be thirstier and dry mouth. for my zyprexa has been amazing!	1
171934	i started the 24mcg for chronic constipation. i took one pill at noon yesterday, 12am today and just took another (11:45 am). i guess i thought i would feel something by now. no real cramps or noises in my bowel, it just seems like it's not doing anything yet. i'm jealous of the people that got immediate relief... it's been almost 2 weeks since i had any movement at all. has anyone switched from this to linzess or are they pretty similar medications?	0
148805	minor bleeding for a few weeks after insitu. after that - none at all. don't even know where i am in my cycle- no pain or bleeding. only cost $30 for 5 years! feel sorry for those who don't have one!	1
43211	combined with prednisone 20mg twice daily, and zyrtec, also with a epsom salt bath with lye soap, it really does work, and quickly.	1
136433	my derm gave me some samples to try because i can't afford laser treatments. applied some on day one. a little sting but that was gone quickly. within minutes i noticed a definite reduction in the redness. within an hour my face was just slightly pink. spent the day enjoying not having to look at the deep red on my face in the mirror. day two was a different story. the rebound was so bad the redness was back even worse than before and the pain was excruciating. even had some puffiness like my skin was rebelling. i chucked all the samples in the trash. i'll never mirvaso again. hope others have better luck.	0
162574	i started meridia 3 weeks ago and already lost 15lbs. diet and exercise is a must. i feel happier and have a lot more energy.	1
1828	urgent care doc gave me colcrys and voltaren for a flare up in my kneee. first flare ever in knee, wow, i thought it was bad in the foot, but it's nothing compared to the knee! the doctor gave me a 3 day supply, buy the end of day 1 i was at least 75% better, by the end of day two no pain. this worked wonders for me, good luck to you.	1
232202	was on this tablet for 11 years and it changed my life. foolishly reduced the dose 6 months ago to prepare to come off them and have relapsed. back on them 10 days now and waiting for them to kick in. wish i'd stayed on them now - they literally saved my life.	1
146473	this medicine helped as far as frequent trips to bath room at night. but i have about 90% of the listed side effects. after all these years of complaining the dr has never implicated that flomax had anything to do with my symptoms. i am dumb founded!	0
49508	had no problems at all while on this pill. lost weight, periods were lighter, skin got better, didn't get pregnant. the only reason i'm stopping is because i'm getting the implant now but if that doesn't work out i'm definitely going back to this pill! i highly recommend it.	1
148425	this is my 3rd device &amp; i have had the mirena for over 13years. on my 3rd insert my gynaecologist asked if i have been depressed and i said yes thinking it was because i was working full time single mum and was tired. i finally had counselling and felt good again but after a few weeks i was drained. however during these years, i was deeply depressed and severe anxiety issues, on medication and after speaking to my female doctor we worked out it was the bloody mirena, all those years of feeling awful. use condoms instead, trust me it's not worth it. i am 41 &amp; love being myself again.	0
207650	i read a review that said this stuff was &quot;invented by lucifer&quot;, and it was the most accurate thing ever. this stuff is nasty. do not drink it with a straw. you need to chug as much of it as you can, and then suck on a lemon wedge. i wish i had read the reviews prior to choking down the first bottle, but the lemon was a life saver for the second bottle. smells okay, tastes like a super salty/sweet grape drink on crack. worst thing i've ever had to ingest. as far as the cleaning out process, this stuff is great. i had zero cramps or pain, but that may be because of my vegan diet prior to this procedure. no nausea (except while drinking this), and no vomiting. bowels emptied and it eventually was only the drink itself leaving my body.	1
164559	i have avn and i began taking the medicine before core depression surgery. i almost decided not to have the surgery as the medicine worked so well. i take it now once a day as i recover from the surgery and it works really well. i don't have to take hydrocodone any more. my doctor says i will have to stop taking it soon. i have had a stomach ulcer 15 yrs ago and he is concerned but i take zantac and i have had no side effects as of yet. it has been three months.	1
22458	i suffer from chronic migraines and i have seen multiple neurologists and have tried numerous medications. treximet was the first that actually got rid of my migraines. within half an hour my migraine is gone. treximet is expensive but for me it is well worth it.	1
102526	took abilify along with lithium. abilify is very helpful for mania mood swings. i also noticed that when &quot;voices&quot; or loud thoughts in my mind were disruptive, abilify was able to remove those. as most drugs, there were some side effects i did not like. abilify did cause me to feel a bit dazed or doped, which also caused sleepiness during the day. it did not help me with depression, and seemed to contribute to it because of the sleepiness and dazed feeling. however, this drug was effective with the mania, and handy to have is the loud thoughts or &quot;voices&quot; are a problem.	1
158311	amrix is the only muscle relaxer that works for me, and i tried a lot. i also take topamax and get botox injections for my migraines. i'm on a low dose antidepressant also. this treatment seems to work for me. i went from 20 migraines a month down to about 5.	1
194976	i have been taking keppra for 4 years. when i keep up with 2000mg dose daily i rarely have seizures anymore. when i go off the medicines they come back. i would have to say it does the trick with minimal side effects.	1
145584	i'm coming to the end of one year on this medication. it has worked very well for me, causing almost a 50 pound weight loss. i went from the initial low 3+ mg dose to a 11.25 mg. some things i noticed while taking this medication: *high irritability/moodiness/depression for the first 2-3 days after increasing doses (i'm also on citalopram) *i've lost this weight without having to change my diet or add exercise. it has simply decreased my appetite. *now that i'm stepping down the dosage, i'm experiencing high levels of hunger and am gaining roughly five pounds per week (consistent for the past 2-3 weeks)	1
100689	i had massive leakage by cheating and eating a butterfly cake -- do not do this!! i thought i was farting but i sharted instead and had go home and change my trousers as a ton of orange fluid soaked through! i also had white coloured stools which can indicate liver damage which is one of the side effects.	0
46474	provigil gets 9 out of 10 only because of the extreme headache i get when i don't take it a--with lots of water (and a little food in my stomach) and b--before 10am. i've had multiple sclerosis for 7 years now and have been on provigil for the last few years to fight the fatigue and lack of focus associated with ms. and it even has the &quot;bonus&quot; side effect of making me happy again. most people who have ms know that depression is also a silent struggle that never gets acknowledged. provigil makes me physically less &quot;worn out&quot;, makes me mentally alert and makes me emotionally just in a better mood. i guess i can't say enough good things about it. if you can tolerate the headache you might get, this medicine is worth it.	1
53218	diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2006, but i'm fairly sure it was there for at least another 10 years prior. i have a carer and i'm really grateful for the family i have and their unadulterated kindness. i don't know where i'd be without them. over the last decade, i have been put on more medicines than i can count. pain relief; everything from diamorphine epidural to tramadol; or ketamine to fentanyl. having never been one to rely overly on medicine. oxycodone hcl (shortec) worked very well for about 2 years, then the doctor upped the dose 50% with minimal benefit. i have been prescribed oral morphine liquid, slow release capsules which work consistently as a medicine, particularly the ampoules. minimal side effects, huge relief.	1
112706	it works very well but costs about $150.00 for 30 day supply.	1
178040	two hours after taking this medicine, i was back in my doctor's office with probably the worst migraine headache i've ever had.	0
21174	they put me on palperidone and within a week, i was very aggressive. they took me straight off it again.	0
219713	it didn&rsquo;t work for me so i&rsquo;m giving it a one. no terrible side effects except i was really tired in the mornings. i took it at night.	0
20839	tried it a few times but it gave me horrible, disturbing nightmares each time i used it! besides that, it was not helpful in actually getting me to sleep.	0
53704	i have needed to get my four wisdom teeth pulled out for 2 years now. and just on this medication until surgery. my mandible which is my lower jaw and gums are very swollen and infected not so much pain in my upper areas in my mouth. my dentist prescribed me tylenol #3 with codeine and antibiotics . tylenol #3 is a joke it does not help with my pain at all it just makes me very drowsy. when i do rest the pain is still severe.	0
215153	the nausea hit within 20 minutes or so. i kept trying to vomit in the toilet, but just dry heaving. i was crying at the same time and my poor cat was standing near me crying, too. i was sick for hours and really thought about calling an ambulance. i laid down with a blanket and was shivering. this has been the worst experience i have ever had with a prescription drug. i feel so bad i will not be able to take my other meds tonight. i am afraid i will throw them up.	0
134437	so, tonight i decided to go to an e.r for my extremely awful wisdom tooth pain that started about 4-5 days ago. i've not eaten solid foods in 3 days because of it... and the nurse comes in and gives me the shot in my arm. first of all, why give someone a shot that causes pain, when they're already in pain? it felt like the nurse pulled my shoulder out of place when she injected me. i literally could not move my arm for like 20 or so minutes. so yeah, tooth hurt less because i was busy with the awful shoulder pain. second, did absolutely nothing for my wisdom tooth pain. now, i'm having pain in my kidney area and soaking in a hot bath trying to figure out why i'd been given this shot, and 800mg of ibuprophen when it clearly says not to mix.	0
127300	have never experienced such a high quality of sleep since 8 years, was very promising. experienced night sweats and vivid dreams at the beginning . but i didn't mind at all because i thought finally i can stop taking benzos and go with this healthier alternative. after the 3rd day and increasing with each day, my preexisting stuttering condition worsened significantly and i began to experience severe anxiety and felt dizzy during the day. my doctor saw me during treatment and a week after stopping and was shocked at how much my stuttering decreased and anxiety reduction. i am so disappointed it didn't work for me. i still recommend people try it.	0
79828	i am taking lomotil because i had surgery. then bone infection set in and i had to take iv antibiotics which caused extensive diarrhea. the first day i took lomotil, it worked great for about 10 hours, but the following days, decreased in its effectiveness. by the third day, it was no longer working for me, but i attribute this to the antibiotics. i will have to let my doctor know so that he can possibly prescribe another anti-diarrhea medicine or change my antibiotic.	0
108603	this product is far inferior to vagifem. i am so sad insurance companies are forcing us to use this due to expense. packaging is terrible and i don't get anywhere near the comfort and relief as from vagifem. i'm not sure how they differ but it should be removed from market or fixed. i've used vagifem for 8 years due to dryness and feeling like a uti. i've now had 5 utis in a row and feel yuvafem is part of the problem.	0
167764	when i got the skyla inserted, i was in excruciating pain. after the insertion, i was cramping so bad and the pain was so bad, i could not stop crying. i sat in a comfortable room with a recliner until the pain subsided. for the first month or so, i felt so dizzy like i had vertigo. i was getting really bad migraines especially at night. now two months later, i don't feel dizzy nor have headaches but i constantly feel pain on my ovaries. when the did the ultrasound, the found a cyst on one of my ovaries. i've been on birth control pills for 12 years and have never felt this pain or pressure before. i hurt almost everyday. i'm thinking about getting the iud removed. i think my body is rejecting it.	0
228348	honestly, i can't even believe this drug is still on the market. sure it may work for a couple weeks, but after i was on this for 3 months back ending in about 2012, i had every side affect listed in the brochure. i literally had to stop by the fire station on the way home from the pain clinic because i felt dizzy and like something wasn't right. my blood pressure was 184/142. the problem was it took over 6 months for it to come down, and now it's like 130/85. this medication also turned my urine black, like blackened blood, that smelled putrid. i got off the medication, then heard it was pulled due to a class action law suit. then i just stumbled on this... wow! i guess if your going to be on it, i wouldn't stay on for more than a mo	0
195975	i have used this drug since the 1960s. it is the best thing on the market for allergies or the beginning of a cold.	1
155296	i cringe when i think about having to take cipro and flagyl. i'm nauseous, dizzy, light headed, ache, and foggy headed. can't function and sleep all the time. i miss a weeks worth of work because i feel so bad.	0
120703	this medication didn't work for me and it gave me some pretty bothersome side effects. i was only taking one 20 mg pill a day for a couple weeks. it made me very loopy and tired. the side effects i had were several severe hot flashes per day. night sweats. chest pain that would last a couple hours until i would randomly belch and it would instantly disappear. stopped taking it and all side effects disappeared. i will never take that pill again.	0
123041	so much better than oxycontin for osteoarthritis in my s.i. joint (cocyx/pelvis). less constipation, better for driving, doesn't impair judgement... 30-60mg/day, compared to 60 oxycontin.	1
38047	hey everyone! i posted on 03/24 and thought i would give an update. since 03/12 to today 04/09 i am down 17 pounds!! i do not exercise any. i no longer have dry mouth like i used to either which is great. i'll update again in about a month when i go back to the dr. side effects at this time is 0.	1
216781	i have been on 10 mg rosuvastatin for a year and my cholesterol went from 10.09 to 6.00. recently it has gone up slightly so has been increased to 20 mg. with this increase i am getting palpitations and can hardly walk with the pain in my right knee. as the days go by, the pain is increasing and the whole leg and muscles are very painful.	0
81214	i was prescribed this pill to treat pms however, taking this medication was the worst experience of my life. it alleviated anxiety but it made me severely depressed and paranoid. i am a fairly active person and i would go running every day. as soon as i began to take the pill i lost motivation to do the things i enjoyed and it got to the point where i did not even want to leave the house. i also almost lost my job over it. i tried to quit three times in one week and luckily my employer would not let me end my career and encouraged me to stay. taking this medication also damaged my relationships with my friends and my partner and almost costed me my relationship. please do not take this medication.	0
84287	i was prescribed tri lo sprintec to use for birth control as well as to help my acne. on day 3 of this pill, my legs began getting very itchy. in the days following, i had sparks of pressure in both of my legs up until day 9 where the pain had become one sided and started making my right leg throb non stop. birth control has ties to blood clots so i was super worried. i stopped taking the pill right away after that and my leg pain went away within 2 days. it also gave me really bad acne even though i had only been on it for less than a week and a half. i do not recommend this pill at all.	0
158320	my husband had a seizure and went into heart failure and died after taking amrix for two days.	0
58060	i live in chronic pain. although i am on another opioid that is the primary care taker of pain, vicodan es has been essential in keeping me functional during the day when pain breaks through and pounds me into the dirt. it is excellent in stopping the breakthrough pain, and although i have been on it on a regular basis for 2 years, when and if i should run out, i do not have withdrawal reactions. i have been foolish enough to just not take the medication when needed due to fear of addiction; however, this is not wise. the &quot;pain cycle&quot; is a cycle you deal with using prudence. bottom line is if you are hurting and are experiencing undue duress, take the prescribed medication and remain comfortable.	1
7888	i've taken xanax for years for occassional insomia. for the past year, i've been battling with high blood pressure along with some new health issues that popped up. for the last two weeks, my heart has been racing and my stomach has had butterflies. i really felt like hiding under the covers and didn't know why. i kept wondering why am i so afraid lying in bed watching tv? i felt as though my heart was about to just rip itself out of my chest. so i decided to take a xanax during the day and it was like a miracle cure. hopefully, the panic attacks wont last forever, but thank god, i had something to help.	1
112785	i took 2 pills around 11am and now i am experiencing severe cramping , i just vomited as well worst feeling ever.. i only had one bm so far but didn't expect i was going to feel this way ... never trying this stuff again big mistake smh	0
111549	this is poison and can cause long term muscular, joint and nerve damage and degeneration. after one pill i felt leg pain and tightness that felt muscular in nature. i talked to my doctor and she didn't associate it with cipro. after another day of taking it, the pain began migrating, heading into my joints and moving all around my body. i popped my shoulder and had excruciating pain taking my briefcase out of my car. i read on line and found out about cipro toxicity. i called my doctor and said i read about this and given my symptoms i thought i should stop it. they agreed. i have been off the pills for 5 days now and still have the roving pains. mostly in legs, shooting, burning, aching, tight alternating. hands,shoulders,knees...	0
161521	does what it says. puts you right to sleep.	1
89537	i also suffer from mild post traumatic stress disorder due to multiple miscarriages. at work and in my personal life i was very irritable - 0-50 in 2 seconds. i thought it was just who i am, until a minor situation happened at work. it opened my eyes, but i was devastated to hear from my doctor that i had to take medication. i felt like a failure. i started out with 20 mg/day, and by the fourth week a miracle happened. i felt &quot;normal&quot; - i started to worry about the things i should worry about, and all the little things did not matter at all. after taking it for 3 months, at times i found my mood to be irritable, so i'm now taking 30 mg/day and have not felt better.	1
936	i'm a 52 yo male in fairly good shape. i started taking metoprolol, 50mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year, in april. it has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low. the side effects are becoming unbearable now though. i'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. i think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. i spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half. i'm hoping some of these side effects will diminish when i cut down to 25mg twice a day.	1
145690	do not waste your money or further your health side effects on this drug it does not work. makes you very exhausted and tired, i had numbness/tingling in the hands, arms, feet, twitching in my eyes; dizziness; trouble sleeping, dry mouth, confusion cloudiness and extensive heartburn.	0
88242	at first it made my tooth infection feel better but before i finished my whole course of the antibiotic i had a severe reaction to it. i had a high fever and painful sore throat.	0
188664	after my 4 th child i went with the para guard not fully decided on if/when we'd have more kids. 10 years gave me plenty of thinking time :) my 4th just started kindergarten and i was thrilled to have a schedule with free time for once. the day before school started i found out i'm pregnant!! i immediately went to the doctor to have it removed but it isn't an easy pull. they couldn't find the string. it shows on an ultrasound still attached but attached right at the pregnancy. too risky to remove. i just had a follow up ultrasound to be sure the pregnancy is viable at 7 weeks and discovered twins!! i know, sounds like a funny prank. it's true. i'm pregnant with twins and the iud is still attached! found outmy sis is preg too iud in place!	0
131567	i was on this medication for about a year and never felt like it ever did anything other than make me irritable and kill my sex drive. it was extremely hard to wean off the 75mg dose which is a comparatively low dose. all up it took me about 6 months to come off it completely and the withdrawal effects after missing a dose would begin within just a few hours (brain zaps, twitchy etc). what i'm amazed about is the fact the doctor who put me on it initially didn't tell me any of the side effects and didn't warn me how hard it was to come off. i realise it probably works for some people but as a dispensary tech i see people coming in who are taking 300mg of this stuff a day. i shudder to think how hard it will be for them to stop this drug.	0
175852	had a severe reaction, my tendons swelled up.	0
156704	my first and second dose made me very sick n nausea. i don't know if i'll feel the same on my 3rd dose. i almost gave up but i'm on my 3rd dose.	1
27232	i have suffered from migraines for 32 years. have taken several medications and combinations of said meds prescribed by my physician to combine. this past year has been a mild one as far as migraines for me but have had around 13 i guess and we tried imitrex. i can say that it has worked for me. my migraines are triggered by the changes in barometric pressure due to weather so i almost always have them in spring and autumn.	1
205655	i was on this medicine for 2 days (i know, i should have had more time). i had so many side effects i can't mention them all here but i just felt awful. i called my doctor and they said it's not for me. there were to many side effects and that was only 2 days on it.	0
86490	i have only been on invokana for a few months. i have had severe yeast infections that keep coming back. i just get rid of one and a week later it's back, its driving me crazy!	0
109548	i have nexoplanon since 2015 april so long enough to be able to share my experience. i have red all these horrible reviews and have to say that remember that everyone is different. i sure can relate to some of them, but have to say please give it a chance to your body to adjust to new contraception before writing it off. i have to agree first few months were really hard. i had terrible mood swings, spotting almost daily and acne. it was hard to be patent, but i stuck with it and most of side effects were gone after 6 months. i still get a bit more spots on my face and back then i did before implant, but my periods are completely gone for almost 1 year now, which i love and mood swings are back to normal.	1
167272	we had sex day 9 of cycle. he didn't pull out-took plan b onestep within 2hrs. no side effects. day 31 of cycle-took clear blue easy- not pregnant (23 days after sex) im age 48,sexually active, irregular periods that can be 20 -50 days apart(perimenopausal) may not be ovulating every month. i could say the pill worked by delaying ovulation, which on regular 28 day person could have happened between day 12-14. on the flip side, odds of it being due to pill working could be 50/50. i'm healthy, sometimes not ovulating, he is 50, plus uses medical marijuana-3strikes already-odds of conception is lowered. we used pull out method for over 10 years- didn't want to take small chance-happy to have option of plan b!	1
231416	i am on the 50mg and the first night of taking trazadone was great slept straight 8hours. the next day didn't work at all. was up all night. i believe that it hasn't worked as great as the first time. i took one tab(50mg) and can't sleep.(tonight 2a) should i go one more tab 100mg? afraid it could do me harm? i am getting more sleep than before but still not enough. i am 5ft 2in around 150 pounds	0
2654	i have been on plaquenil 200 mg twice a day for 6 years and it has helped me tremendously. i couldn't get up from a chair or close my fists after being diagnosed with primary sjogrens syndrome. it took about a year, and i'm 90 % better. i am very careful to have a thorough eye exam every year to monitor potential ocular side effects. it is worth a try and the side effects are definitely less than long term steroid use.	1
91487	initially, i tolerated the drug well. about 4 months into treatment, i had a lot of problems: dizziness, disorientation, joint and muscle pain and stomach upset. also, my hair started to thin, and nails cracked due to dryness. within a week of stopping the drug i was feeling better. one month out and i was very well.	0
82877	i've been on this for a couple months now it has helped but one issue all i do is sleep.	0
39316	i've been on contrave for 3 weeks. it's expensive, even with the downloaded card. i started the 4 pills/day yesterday. today i had my follow up appt w/my dr. &amp; i gained 3 lbs :( contrave has not suppressed my appetite, i crave carbs like crazy now. my dr. gave me another prescription for 3 more months depending on how i do with the 4 pills per day. i'll continue with the contrave for the remainder of the month &amp; hope that with the full daily dose, i'll begin to benefit from contrave. i truly hope something works! i'm going to restrict my carbs and try to fight the urge.	0
16083	i was on microgestin for 5 months. although it solved my original problem of severe cramping (what i thought was ovarian cysts), microgestin had many side effects for me. i experienced nausea right before periods, depression, anxiety, and extreme mood swings. i was sleeping a lot during the day which caused me to not sleep at night. i am switching to trinessa and hope it fixes these problems.	0
205186	absolutely terrible birth control. i've been on this for 4 months and had nothing but problems. nonstop bleeding and vagina blood clots (6 in one day and largest the size of an egg). horrible pain like my right ovary was going to blow up inside of me. my boobs have swollen so much (2 cup sizes) and hurt. gained 15 pounds. have cravings and bad mood swings. i feel like this has too many hormones or too much released. i would highly recommend not getting this. constant problems and it's not worth it. i was on the depo shot for 5 years and had no problems but the nexplanon is terrible.	0
8391	i work at a bar. last night was the first night i started ambien and i fell right to sleep, woke up early, went for a jog i feel amazing.	1
204142	took dilantin for several years, since the 1980's. now it's apparent i have a secondary disability of osteoporosis after seeing a endocrinologist and having a bone density test done. my doctor says it is likely due to the regular use of epileptic medicines with dilantin being the most likely source.	0
85994	very good experience i had tried many other pills and this is the only one that doesn't upset my stomach, i was so happy about that because i have gastritis, also my mood stabilized which was the main reason i was put on this medicine because i have extreme pms. i gained 4lbs the first 2 weeks but i watched what i was eating and went back to normal weight, no extra pimples, some blood in the middle of the cycle and tender breast. overall good	1
198116	no side effects but did not provide a stiff erection.	0
198252	if you don't have a gall bladder, suffer any form of stomach/bowel issue or have an arthritic issue (me dupuytrens/ledderhose) then don't take this drug. seriously it has completely stuffed up my stomach which is still ongoing 3 weeks after stopping it. i found it also inflamed my dupuytrens. i also had the autoimmune response to the injections and now have numerous lumps on my stomach. i used it 5 times.	0
11977	i started taking fastin a few days ago after i read so many good reviews...i must say that i did take the advice of so many others and started with half of the pill. it seemed to put me in the best mood and my energy level went through the roof. not to mention..i wasn't hungry at all. yes it did make me feel a bit jittery so i drank a lot of water and had to pee quite often. don't drink anything with caffiene in it while taking this because it makes you even more jittery, plus if you work in the heat be careful because i felt like i was having hot flashes but wow...it is definitely worth it. lost a couple of lbs already. well worth it for me.	1
196592	i've been taking femara for a little over 5 months and have yet to experience any side effects whatsoever. i'd been warned about hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain, muscle pain, and so far nothing. i have two smallish tumors in one breast that we caught very early on, and at my 4 month ultrasound they've decreased by about 50%. i'll have a nipple-sparing mastectomy in about 2 weeks with diem flap reconstruction...the grossest part of this whole episode in my opinion...followed by radiation. no chemo here, just a very healthy mostly vegetarian diet and tons of walking. i'm 69, 5'6&quot;, 135, and so far consider myself about the luckiest cancer patient anywhere. maybe i'll start feeling sick at some point but not yet. hang in there ladies!!	1
225161	i have been taking this med almost for 2 weeks. i was extremely skeptical, because of everything i have read and heard of this med. i have been smoking since i was around 18yr., i'm now 30. anyways, the first 3 days were rocky and i almost quit taking, but realized it was just my body adjusting. it has had a positive affect, no adverse side effects, just mild like: dry mouth and tired. i don't recommend for someone who has severe depression or other psychological issues that could cause adverse effects. i take 150mg 2x a day. i do not use any other nicotine replacements. i do not go to therapy. lastly i haven't had a cigarette in 3 days.	1
203012	i have never written a review in my 21 years of life but i feel i should share my experience. about a little over a month ago i got on this pill. not to brag but i have a decent happy life. the first couple of days i noticed no symptoms and was so happy.. out of no where i started waking up with migraines and breaking out.. i figured ok no big deal.. i didn't connect it with the pill. next thing you know, i get upset and mad about literally everything. work..family.. boyfriend. my life was going downhill everyday.. depressing thoughts.. finally my boyfriend and i put it together and figured out it was the birth control. i immediately stopped and thank god i am feeling better as the days go by. not to mention everyday spotting! not worth it	0
213901	let me tell you.. this stuff is not for the weak! my hot pocket was on fire about 30-45 mins after i inserted that devil stick in me. i really think it made me worse because now it hurts to even put my underwear on. definitely going with the 3 day cream next time. i've never felt a burn and ich so bad in my life. my hot pocket is literally swollen. also the medicine ran out of me like ginger ale and alka-seltzer's had got together in there and had a party.	0
214135	omg! i have used the ovule before with no reaction but this time i have been miserable! i inserted the ovule about 3 hours ago and now i am having some intense itching and the anti-itch cream that came with it is not relieving anything. needless to say, i don't think i will be using this product again	0
113042	i've had normal bm for all of my life (34) until recently with a 2 week bout of constipation. i've been popping out number 1's on the bristol scale bidaily. tried a little mineral oil, olive oil, mass hydration, stool softeners, and a change of diet. no change. frustrated i was told &quot;dulcolax was where it was at, just take 2 and you'll have the best poop of your life&quot;. this was so far from the truth. i'm on my second day of missed work of a 3 day ordeal. my insides feel like they have been detached. i can feel the entirety of my large intestine from tip to tail. car rides and seat belts, laughing, sneezing, sudden movements in general reverberate pain through my colon. this is all after that nightmare of a night described by others here.	0
155403	first time with bv, although i had no discharge or odor, so i couldn't get the diagnosis really quickly. anyhow, i have been taking this drug (metronidazole) with milk and a little food twice a day and have no crazy side effects that everyone else seems to have. sure, it tastes bad, but i can't believe i didn't get the nausea like so many others, considering i feel like i have a wimpy body when it comes to everything else. it's been fine in this case, and on day 4 i feel i'm about 99 percent better.	1
101406	i took viorele for a single month. i have experienced the worst acne i've had in years, my depression has gotten significantly worse, my blood pressure (which is usually spot on perfect) is frequently high, and my mood swings are horrible.	0
51273	i suffer from chronic sinusitis. allergic to doxycycline. azithromycin is a life saver. its great.	1
228892	i have been a type one diabetic for 21 years. i'm 30 and have trouble getting and keeping an erection. this medication is working well in making me confident and able to preform. 10 mg does the job.	1
114559	i had severe eczema on my face, forehead and my cheeks and eyebrows all my life. it was so scaly, flaky and itchy on a daily basis that due to my constant scratching, i had no eyebrows left as they had fallen out due to the constant scratching and the skin was so damaged that new eyebrows couldn't grow. and my face was always red like i had severe sunburn. i started using using elidel just over 10 years ago. and after just a few weeks of using elidel my face actually started to heal. my skin totally changed its texture, tone and colour back to what it should have been originally. there was no more itching or the need and desire to scratch. it has totally eradicated the eczema and has been absolutely life changing.	1
158765	i use daytrana for adult adhd. unlike most other adhd medicines (except maybe vyvanse), it is very smooth, meaning there is no crash at the end of the day, or big jolt in the morning. i just feel very calm and i can concentrate much better and it's the best add medicine i've tried. i take 30mgs and keep it on 12-16 hours. a few things in reference to other raters. some doctors allow the patch to be on for 24 hours. that would help with the child that had problems in the evening (something to ask your doctor about). the patch was originally designed for 24 hours (so there is enough medicine in the patch to wear it that long), but during clinical trials, there were skin issues hence the 9 hour limit.	1
195384	did nothing to slow down the progression but did help with the muscle cramping and twitching.	0
109614	i've had this thing in my arm for a little over a year. first, my periods are so random, and last for weeks at a time. i've gained 35 pounds despite my increase in workouts!!! my depression/anxiety is at an all time high, which makes it hard to do just about anything let alone have sex, which is the reason i have this dang thing in the first place. i get nauseous very easily and suddenly. i also tend to have headaches that last for days on end. this implant has caused me more problems than having a second child would have! i have an appointment with my doctor to remove it, and i cannot wait to be done with this thing and feel like myself again. it might be convenient ladies, but it just isnt worth it.	0
37561	i am 44 years old and was recently diagnosed as add. i am a successful professional that always had to work a little harder to achieve results due to my lack of concentration and tendency toward distractions. i started taking vyvanse, and have to admit i felt like superwoman for about a week and ranted and raved about how much i was getting done without the jittery feeling most stimulants provide. but then all in one day, i crashed. i started getting extremely agitated. i then would get so angry i would cry hysterically. i quit taking the medication and within a few days my mood and attitude have leveled off. although, i have suffered from extreme vertigo and exhaustion since i have been off this medicine. i was on 30mg.	0
110024	i received my insert in november of 2015. my period stopped for the rest of november and december. i didn't have any side effects. then comes january of 2016. must be the new year. i don't know. but after january 1st struck...everything went downhill. i started spotting constantly. i started getting acne around my chin. one zit goes away, 3 more appear. i started getting dizzy every time i went into the store. to the point where i stopped wanting to go to stores. i started feeling bloated and gross all the time. gained 10 pounds which has taken 5 months to loose 6 of. and i'm talking about running 3 miles 5 days a week. after spotting literally for almost 1/2 a year, i decided it's time to throw in the towel and get it removed :(	0
18360	i went through half a tube of this garbage and it didn't work at all... and i got to be sticky as well... so that was fun.	0
86428	severe yeast infections that caused bleeding and the strongest type of medications wouldn't knock it out.	0
11893	second day after first injection, woke up with the worst case of sour stomach i have ever experienced. burps were out of control frequent and absolutely disgusting smelling and tasting. made it to work only to vomit twice in 3 hours... almost messed myself in the process... diarrhea was also in full water effect. thankfully i was able to leave early (within 1 hour of second episode). i hope these symptoms decrease dramatically and rapidly. anyone else experience side effects this severe? i am literally unable to leave my bathroom's side. can not even attempt to work or leave the house without fear of needing a new outfit. i took 1, 1.5 injection.	0
97981	although the spotting does suck , its 100% effective. i would recommend it to everyone. i still have normal mood swings, bloating and cramping , but nothing like what i've read in some of the reviews. the only real side effect i've gotten was a really bad headache and the spotting. best perk, i don't have to worry about getting pregnant for 3 years. suck it up ladies and use it. i didn't get mine to reduce my periods, i got it cause i don't want kids.	1
146660	flow has improved, but i have the equivalent of a permanent head cold. after two months, i have trouble breathing through my nose, and sleep fully. it's not worth it. i will try avodart, and if that doesn't work, i will have surgery.	0
228578	when i first went on geodon, it was like a sigh of relief. the first day i slept all day, but the grogginess passed. i took 160 mg once daily (the 80 mg twice daily didn't work, as it made me groggy). i had slight headaches and akathesia, but it was tolerable, and my mood was greatly improved. no rage or mood swings or delusions. unfortunately, i started getting depressed, and was bumped up to 240 mg. big mistake. i became a total zombie. i barely laughed, i couldn't read, i had no emotions or interests. i lay in bed all the time. i lost 20 pounds and didn't have increased appetite, which was a plus, but i was so tired. this medicine is a good one, just be careful you aren't put on a high dose.	1
136348	i have post traumatic stress disorder and suffer from night terrors and have been on prazosin and this does not help with my night terrors.	0
41863	as a mom of 5 i put my life into my kids. never have experienced addiction, no smoking, no drinking...i started taking hydrcodone 10mg for a herniated disc. after a while my tolerance grew so i started taking more than prescribed, buying more from friends of friends. what a low for a mom, right? clonidine, 0.5mg, has saved me. it was so hard to go and admit to my doctor (who delivered my kids) that i was doing this. it was so worth the embarrassment. withdrawal symptoms are i would say 80% gone with clonidine. i feel like if i can do it, anyone can. you're not alone!!!! stay strong!!!	1
209214	scary medicine given for migraine, sent home. had hallucinations bad.	0
102698	i have had it all basically. had a manic episode in 2009, and then a repeat in 2011, but not as severe. i was okay before that had had no problems with anything maybe a little anxiety. now that i am older and on my own most days i've had some pretty rocky months, and i was concerned and a bit frightened that the depression would rip me up. i was hesitant to try it because i take ativan during the day. my doctor suggested abilify. i have bipolar as well and can't take any antidepressants. he told me to start with a quarter for a week, and really thought it wouldn't work. it was a miracle. i then started taking 2mg at night and have been noticing i've been waking up earlier. doing things that i would hold off till 3pm. wonderful.	1
117306	been using for 8 months on right big toenail and left and right smallest toenail. applying everyday faithfully, no results. pay $40 a month copay. what a rip off. do not buy and do not waste your money. why are doctors prescribing this medication when it is not working for so many people? of course, they get money off this also. so many desperate fools out there being exploited once again by the medical profession. one doctor told me point blank--&quot;you will never get rid of this problem.&quot; he was right. do not buy jublia!!!!	0
225936	wellbutrin did not work for me; made me more depressed, joint pain, muscle pain and ringing in ears.	0
83563	took this for seasonal allergies. knocked out cold for 9 hours, woke up feeling hungover. went out with family for breakfast, came back home and slept 5 more hours. awful! i don't know how people could function taking this regularly.	0
224294	i have been on levothyroxin for four years. i have no thyroid. i have gained 60 pounds. i am angry about the weight gain. i have absolutely no energy when i used to have too much. the major problem that i found with this drug is that it gives me bad heart burn. i also have heart palpitations. the doctor claims my levels are where they should be and refuse to switch me to anything else.	0
231450	i suffer from total insomnia. i was given klonopin at first but it suddenly became ineffective. so i was put on trazodone, 70 mgs one hour before bed time. i can rely on 6 hours of solid sleep with no or just a couple of awakenings. the drug kept working even during benzo withdrawal. the first week i took it my eyes were somehow dry, i could feel my blood pressure dropping while walking in the sun and a little hangover when awake. but the side effects disappeared soon. it even worked a little as antidepressant and i feel slightly more peaceful now. i rely on this drug for sleeping at the moment.	1
132082	liver transplant 8 years ago. no problems.	1
48155	i have had migraines for quite sometime, and my doctor tried the sumavel today. i felt a little dizzy and heavy but 15 minutes later migraine was completely gone. i immediately called my mom who has suffered from migraines for 15 years to tell her about it. highly recommended!	1
42881	i do not like the patch at all. i'd used ortho evra version years ago in college, and the only downside was the constant tiredness and mood swings. this version of the patch has produced the worst body systems, ever. the constant gas/bloating, heavy periods with cramps that last over a week, constant hunger/weight gain, and the mood swings. i've gained roughly 15lbs, but the kicker is that i do not eat a lot. i don't even have dairy in my normal diet and i do not eat fried food or junk food. it just seems like my body is packing on the weight, still. the only reason why i even gave it a 3 is because of the ease of use and not having to worry to take it. i am switching off of this soon.	0
167375	i decided to write a review because of the many negative experiences about insertion. the procedure was slightly painful, but tolerable. mental preparation helped a lot. it was quick, about 2 minutes. cramps the day of and day after felt like a heavy period. however, i did not spot at all afterward and i still haven't spotted. i did yoga about 2 hours after insertion and it helped eliminate all of the cramping. physical activity and heating pads help immensely but even without cramps aren't that bad.	1
38171	albuterol tablet has serious side effects. i have been trembling, extremely tired, muscle weakness, unsettled and completely abnormal feeling for 24 hours. i had to take off work today due to side effects not my initial ailment! please be careful prescribing this docs.	0
57704	my experience with this drug was very good it help my pain. i would recommend it to others if they were in pain. do not abuse this drug that ruins it for the people who really need it	1
45264	i lost my sexuality from the first pill, overnight it went from 100% to 0%. was told it was a common sideeffect, so i continued using prozac (called fontex here i norway), after a while i didn't want thouse sideeffect so i stopped using. but my loss of ibido and ed continued. now 3-4 years later my problems is still the same, doctors refuse to belive me, but i'm certain, i had very high sex drive before my first prozac/fontex pill. no i can't keep my erection more than 5 seconds and my penis often feels numb. this pill should have been illegal. (sorry for my poor english)	0
89526	it makes me feel normal. i like it, but i sometimes get hot flashes and dry mouth. my husband also takes it and it does well for him but has sexual side effects.	1
67432	hi! i'm 18 years old and ever since i've had my first period, it's been irregular. i've even been up to 6 months without it. it's my first time with provera. i got my period two days after 10 days of taking the pill. the only side effects that i have had are that i've sort of had hair loss and frequent headaches. other than that, i've always had pms.	1
91935	i was having terrible pain with sciatica. at times i was in so much pain just walking in a shopping centre i just had to stop. also driving the car my leg was in so much pain i had to lift it up with my hand to ease the pain. no medication i had taken stopped the pain which was unbearable and i couldn't sleep at night, my doctor prescribed lyrica and at first i did not like it because it made my feet puffy however i went back on it with the prescribed dose of 150mg twice a day. now i have to try to recall the pain because i have no sciatic pain at all with this drug. it also had the side effect of making me a bit &quot;dreamy&quot; which i rather like but i do forget names and things i am saying which i do not like. can't have it all though!	1
156220	my doctor prescribed me 5mg concor. when i started my 208-213 bpm heart rate drops to 70-100 bpm. and also said that if this wouldn't help to drop we can make catheter ablation operation. i also test to give up the pills for 2 days then it again start to beat at 180-200 bpm. so i am good with 1 pill 5mg for a day.	1
154481	great medication. my pressure prior to using tribenzor averaged 160-170 / 90-95. it is now averaging about 130/75. i have been taking it for just over a month. minimal side effects, mostly slight dizzy spells when getting up too quickly. i previously used many combinations of individual pills with mostly negative results. i highly recommend this combination all in one pill.	1
99618	this stuff is nasty! but it does its job. i managed the finish the first dose and all the water afterwards before going to the bathroom. i only spent about 5 minutes each trip and went consistently every 30 minutes. no close calls or anything. then came the second dose and i could only get half down and i threw it up a bit. i took my second dose at 9pm and was asleep by 11:30 and only had to get up once. my doctor said i did a great job with the prep and everything came back fine!	1
92036	works pretty well for nerve pain and numbness. i have degenerative disc disease along with several other cervical and spinal issues. i started at higher dose that had too many side effects but when my dosage was lowered i had a lot of relief.	1
156517	finally i have found a drug that works for me! in 2 months i have lost 25lbs. my sugar levels are at an all time low. yes i get some nausea and a little upset stomach but nothing different than before being on other shots/meds. what i have found that works for me is eating a heck of a lot less. if your not feeling hungry, don't eat unless your sugar is low of course. eat very small portions. if you start to feeling full, stop eating! very small portions and relax. that's my .02 this is the best drug i have found since being diabetic but being a realist, drugs react differently to the individual. you won't know till you try.	1
125821	this was the worse, made the worse choice in trying this new pill, in one month i did the change slowly, i have bad headaches, i can't sleep, i have the worse taste in my mouth, ringing in my ears, very moody and crying all the time. we don't smoke and all i smell no matter where i go is old ashtrays. never again so back on my lexapro. don't try this its not worth it.	0
184004	i take 25mg vistaril twice a day for anxiety. i had been suffering from gad and a specific phobia for eight years and had never tried any medication. at first i was taking just 25mg at bedtime and it still caused significant drowsiness during the day. the drowsiness has worn off but the medication is still controlling my anxiety and helping me sleep more, which in turn makes me more cheerful and relaxed. i know that it doesn't work for everyone, but for me it has worked excellently.	1
216809	i used crestor for about 3 weeks before i started having muscle and joint pain. then i began having horrible spasms in my muscles that would wake me every night. i called my doctors office and they told me to take 1/2 a pill every other day. i did as he suggested, but didn't get relief until taken off this medicine. it did however lower my numbers.	0
3165	the side effects. today i went to the dr with symptoms of cloudy urine and frequent urination. i was diagnosed with a bladder infection and i was prescribed macrobid, 2x po daily for 5 days. i've taken this medication before for a uti and i was fine, but for some reason, i took this pill 2 hours ago and already i feel the sensation to gag every time a breathe in. this kind of nausea feels detestable. i'm so uncomfortable. i also got severe back pain and tight chest out of nowhere. i can't believe this.	0
60399	after more than a year of taking a pill every day i was tired of it so my doctor suggested the ring. i am currently on my second month and it seems to be working fine. i'm actively trying to lose the rest of my baby weight and it hasn't hindered me in the slightest. it has decreased my sex drive, but that's okay for me. my husband has a high stress job and we don't have sex very often anyway. it actually helps that i'm not as aroused. two reasons that i didn't give it a 10. 1: it's expensive. one ring is almost $70. 2: i vomit uncontrollably on the second day. (is that normal?) i'm fine the rest of the month.	1
139126	i love this medicine. it has no side effects and after a week or two you will lose weight. the only thing i will say is that you should take it for 3 weeks on and then one or two weeks off. once you quit and start back, it is just like when you began. it is a miracle drug.	1
37340	i've been on this medication twice in the past two years. first i was on focalin then vyvanse for about five months till i found out i was pregnant. it helps me a lot. i can focus a lot better but sometimes its hard to tell what i'll be focusing on. sometimes its cleaning or sometimes its researching a very unimportant subject online.	1
388	my normal period last four days. i just started the depo shot, and my period stopped for about a month. two weeks ago i started bleeding, i've been bleeding for 15 days straight! i go in a few weeks to get my next shot. if the bleeding doesn't stop soon, i'm gonna have to go back to the doctor to figure something out. my cousin started the depo before me, her period stopped for a while and then all of a sudden she started bleeding for 12 days straight.	0
85704	to help with bad case of pms (acne, depression, anxiety), decided to start something that will help regulate my periods and balance my hormones. just started this, and now on day 5, and my only complaint is i feel like i have 'morning sickness'. i'm so sick to my stomach not long after taking it. and prescription nausea meds don't help. i'm not expecting the acne to clear up immediately, but on plus side, no depression and anxiety, which is huge win. so far, if the nausea leaves within next couple months, i will continue this medication.	1
25427	was given finasteride as a trial as contiflo (flomax) did not solve issue completely. i stopped after 5 days as finasteride was giving me frequent palpitations. very unsettling. i think the other well-known effect was slowly starting to take effect as well. enough reason for me to stop and rely on contiflo for the time being.	0
81641	hello i started saxenda june 19,2017 been on it for about two weeks now i dropped 8 pounds from 259lb to 251lb . i am at 1.2 right now and i feel absolutely great. i didn't get to nauseous or anything. i m hoping to drop 20lb by the end of this month and lucky me my insurance pays for it nothing out of my pocket	1
135303	fever, chills, nausea, pounding migraine friday, took a dose fri night, saturday morning and by saturday night was feeling better. i was skeptical about the drug and scared of vomiting/nausea/diarrhea side effect but glad that decided to try it. to those who get nauseous taking it, take it with a piece of bread and ginger ale. literally with a piece of plain bread (i had hawaiian sliced) and ginger ale. do not eat a heavy meal. the rx says &quot;take it with a meal or a piece of bread&quot;. nope, do not eat a meal, you will get nauseous. i do want to add that those who are more nauseous than others probably have more mucus in their stomach. just my opinion. i was taking mucinex at the same time so it helped with being nauseous from mucus greatly.	1
51525	so i'm almost a month into using aczone twice a day and minocycline 100mg twice a day. so my face us actually getting worst	0
32535	blood pressure was 180/114 when i started taking lisinopril. it worked well for my bp but the side effects were more than i could handle. fatigue, nausea and daily vomiting. we are in the process of trying to find a better option.	0
13065	took it lost 150 lbs kept it off for a while using every day. became addicted 1 wasn't enough...needed more and more. ended up a speed addict. got clean and my metabolism was a mess. i thought i could control the drug ...but it ended up controling me. i gained it all back and then some. found weight watchers and over eaters anonymous.	0
197946	i am taking metoprolol 50mg 3 times per day since the beginning of january and my heart rate is still very high137 bpm on average for a seventy one year old male previously active and in good health. when i climb stairs i am short of breath feel weaker than normal. previous taking digoxin 62.5mg x3/day. this controlled/capped my hr at 115bpm without side effects. so my hr has increased by comparison since starting metoprolol. i would welcome all your comment.	0
174895	i had been using cialis which worked for a boost for about four years, and in the fifth year even after taking a dose, i didn%u2019t have interest in sex. my doctor ran blood test and determined my t level was low. for the past 4 month i have used the 2.5 gram androgel packs daily. i generally feel better. i have lost my belly flab. my love interest is better although i still rely on the cialis, but now i have total control of my orgasm. i have lost testicle size, in fact, at times they will ascend into the inguinal canal until i push them back out. in short this 64 year old would say that androgel is a nice improvement.	1
214088	i never write reviews but i feel morally obligated to tell every one that if you love your vagina don't ever use this! this was the most painful experience of my life. i cried for 2 hours. this devils egg feels like behives and fire ants crawled up your vagina and you can't get it out. still waiting to see if it cured my infection but it's been 15 hours and my vagina is so swollen inside every time i walk it feels like it's chaffing. do not use this!	0

38186	why does proair keep making bigger and bigger inhalers!?! over the years they have gotten huge and hard to carry around. i often carry my inhaler in my pocket or in my purse (which is small), but i just picked up the new proair and it's way too big. i can't even put it in my pocket. plus i find the fact that you can't take it apart and wash it really disgusting. directions say to wipe it off, but this thing is going in my mouth...i prefer soap and water which you can't do with this inhaler. i'm going back to the old stuff.	0
44560	diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 10 days ago. started 800mg 2 tablets, 3 times/day plus suppository at night. diarrhea quickly went down to once a day instead of eight times. experiencing fatigue, slight nausea and seem to be developing acne.	1

28504	i was less upset on this medicine but much much more anxious. tried 5mg-20mgs and different doses didn't change the anxiety levels.	0
6086	so, i had been experiencing irregular and painful periods due to low body fat and my lifestyle (i am an avid runner). my doctor said i was suffering from amenorrhea. so he placed me on minastrin. literally within a week and 5 days of taking the medicine, i broke out in severe hives on my legs and arms which were red and itchy. i called my doctor and told him and he suggested that i take benadryl for the allergic reaction. the benadryl did not help. i also was experiencing mood changes where i would either be down in the dumps or angry at the world. i was then instructed to stop taking it and begin a new one. one day after not taking the medicine, i started bleeding heavily and having severe cramps. 1st time i ever had bc.	0

186335	i have been taking pristiq for 1 week. 43y male. first time treating depression. i could &quot;feel&quot; a difference within hours. hard to believe maybe, but it was a slight improvement. every day (every single day) has been better than the one before. it is gradual, but very noticeable. my wife says &quot;you are coming back&quot; and my son says &quot;thank you for not freaking out so much&quot; and my co-workers are noticing. i even told a joke in a crowd this week (instead of just feeling like i want to leave and be alone) - i am amazed. i had sweats and some minor side effects in the first 4 days, but they are completely gone. i am so thankful for this medication. thank you to the scientists who developed this. you are changing my life for the better!	1
177108	promethazine quickly relieved my upset stomach/nausea due to other medicines (i think, who knows, maybe it was a bad meal or lack of nutrients in my body) i love to have this medication in my cupboard if ever my stomach acts up, or if i have an allergic reaction to something. a full dose makes me very relaxed and i generally take a nap. a half a dose just gets rid of the ailment and i can still function in my day. i love this little &quot;cure&quot;!	1
4652	fantastic drugs. lost a lot of weight with no side effects.	1
113730	this works well if i take it when the migraine is just starting. it will stop the migraine but i may still get a head ache but it wont be debilitating.	1
45905	i have been taking prozac for at least 8 years and it helps keep me from being irritated all the time. when i have not taken it for a couple of days, i get what i call &quot;permanent road rage&quot;, ready to snap at the world.	1
50622	i have fibromyalgia and pars defect (slipped disc in l5, s1). i take morphine sulfate 30mg 3 x daily, neurontin 600mg 3x daily. i have noticed a huge improvement in the movement of my body. i can actually bend over without falling to my knees in pain. before i was taking morphine i could tell a difference on the days where i was not taking daily dose of the neurontin. my body would ache and the pain would be awful and distracting. my arms, shoulders, lower back and shooting/dull ache down my legs would flare up when driving or sitting for a period of time. now i am able to sit without needing to lay down every 20-30 minutes. the price is reasonable for those without insurance. hope this helps!	1
89405	when i first started taking it, it really helped me but now it's been over a month and i feel like i did before. i take 40 mg and i need help it's like i am taking nothing at all.	0
37005	i've been an every second of everyday drinker, (24-30) 5.9% ice beers for a year and a half. i started to have severe severe severe withdrawal's and dt's if i wasn't consuming that amount. i went to the dr. and was prescribed ativan. didn't do anything. then i went back and got librium. praises to the most high because i haven't had a drop of beer since. absolutely no withdrawal's and i'm feeling better than ever. 10/10 for librium. highly recommended. good luck!!!	1
22710	the mylan lidocaine patches are a waste of money! they don't stay on your skin for more 2-3 hours. the problems with patches is the patch is not breathable and the adhesive does not move with your body.	0
114205	i have been using fiorinal c1/2 for the past 25-30 years controlled by my doctor. it's an amazing, amazing medicine. i take it and my migraine goes away most of the time on the first dose. i have tried many other migraine meds and it seems i cannot take any of the triptans as they make me throw up immediately upon taking them. i wish i could take something else but fiorinal is all there is. please do not stop making it! there are plenty of us out here who rely on it to carry on our daily lives. please start making it again. thank you.	1
216638	as i get older my asthma worsens which i know is not usual but in my case it is. advair has been a blessing.	1
4086	i only took this 1 evening, it put me to sleep. this was one of the strongest medicines i've taken. i was put on 50 mg. i felt horrible the next day, couldn't concentrate to read, felt more depressed, had to go back to bed in the morning and felt horrible the whole day. luckily my doctor said i could quit it.	0
46128	kremers generic is a great product replacement for the aciphex brand. i highly recommend it, works even better than the aciphex brand for me. i've taken aciphex for 11yrs and kremers generic for 2yrs. i do have blood tests for kidney function twice per year(blood pressure meds) and my kidneys are fine.	1
220390	i have been on loestrin for about 2 months now and i am not satisfied with the result so far. i got on this pill to regulate my periods because i am 18 and wouldn't have a period for about 5 or 6 months apart and the pill has somewhat regulated that but my acne is absolutely horrible. i never had big problems with acne before just little break outs here and there before periods but now i have horrible acne on my cheeks, and its left brown spots behind. i am going to either get off the pill completely or change to another if it doesn't get better within the next 2 weeks. i have also gained 5 pounds, and gone up a cup size.	0
192099	i hate this pill its the second birth control i have been on and i cant wait to switch. i have been on ocella for 6 months and all 6 months have been terrible i've been gaining weight which makes me extremely depressed and i've had really bad mood swings. i am usually a calm, easy going person but ever since i have been on this pill every little thing irritates me or makes me mad. my doctor also assured me this pill would make my period shorter and lighter.....no....not at all. however i have not gotten pregnant so it works in that regard.	0
39334	i am young and considered obese. i am a healthy individual though and just wanted to shed a few pounds. this pill is what my doctor prescribed. i read through all of the side-effects and decided to give it a go. i lost 8 lbs in two weeks but i don't think that was from the pills. i stopped taking them after the first two days. i was so nauseous that i couldn't stand without falling and vomiting and my headaches are so bad that it affects my vision. it is unbearable. i may be fat but now i am happily so if it means never taking these pills again. they literally steal all of your energy and make you miserable.	0
133858	i have used restasis for about a year now and have seen almost no progress. for most of my life i've had red and bothersome eyes. after trying various eye drops, my doctor recommended restasis. he said it typically takes 3 to 6 months for it to really kick in but it never did kick in. when i put the drops in it burns my eyes for the first 30 - 40 minutes. i've talked with my doctor about this and he said it is normal but should go away after some time, but it hasn't. every year around spring time my eyes get terrible irritated and this year has been the same (maybe even worse than other years) even though i've been using restasis for a year now. the only difference i notice was for the first couple weeks, but now i'm ready to move on.	0
226243	what a god send! after menopause at 50 i first thought &quot;yes! no more periods&quot; then the fun started, night sweats, hot flashes at the worst times like during business meetings, my dr. started me on the patch .50 and within 2 days it was like a miracle - i could sleep without a towel on my pillow and the hot flashes disappeared. after a year he dropped the dose to .375 and it's still working. if you are having to fight the sweats and flashes - talk to your dr. this stuff works!	1
